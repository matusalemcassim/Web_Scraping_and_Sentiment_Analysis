# Web Scraping and Sentiment Analysis Project

Welcome to my Web Scraping and Sentiment Analysis project! This repository contains a Python project that demonstrates my ability to gather data from the web and analyze its sentiment. It's an illustrative project showcasing the use of various Python libraries for data science tasks.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the code, there are a few preliminary steps required to set up the environment.

### Prerequisites

This project relies on NLTK for natural language processing and PyTorch for more advanced data processing tasks. Ensure you have Python installed on your system, and then proceed with the installation of these packages.

### Installation

First, install the necessary NLTK packages by running the following commands in your Python environment:

```python
# Download necessary NLTK packages:
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')  # For part-of-speech tagging
nltk.download('maxent_ne_chunker')          # For named entity recognition
nltk.download('words')                      # For the words corpus
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')              # For sentiment analysis

```

# Installing PyTorch

To install PyTorch, follow the instructions below:

1. Go to [PyTorch's Get Started page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
2. Select the installation options that match your environment.
3. Use the generated `pip` command to install PyTorch.

## Project Overview

This project is a simple demonstration of web scraping and sentiment analysis techniques. The primary goal is to extract data from the web, process this data, and perform a sentiment analysis to understand the general sentiment around a specific topic or set of data.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used.
- **NLTK**: A leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data.
- **PyTorch**: An open-source machine learning library used for applications such as natural language processing.
