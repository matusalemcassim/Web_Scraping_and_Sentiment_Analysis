03/22/2024,Csanchez,5.0,1st time there and I will return. The dinner and drinks were perfect.
03/22/2024,ShaquanaN,5.0,I should’ve listened and not wasted $200. The food is not worth it and could be a lot better but the service was outstanding!! I went to celebrate my boyfriend’s 26th birthday and they accommodated everything I asked for ( except singing lol ). They gave us a private booth as requested and a signed card which I thought was a nice touch. Really appreciated the staff but the food is a waste lol.
03/18/2024,MollyS,5.0,"We had the best time, the food was incredible and our server Brian was amazing! He was very attentive and gave us his suggestions and really made our dining experience great."
03/17/2024,RayG,5.0,Absolutely great dinner!  Service was exceptional and food was truly oustanding.  We both had filet mignon and the potato trio which was so delicious.  Perfect dinner evening with a Makers #46 cocktail and we were back on the floor for more fun.  Just a great night.
03/17/2024,BillV,5.0,Always a wonderful dining experience. Look forward to returning soon
03/14/2024,MarcS,4.0,"I really enjoyed the experience at MJ's restaurant; however, it was a very special occasion being my wife and I celebrating our 25 anniversary and so our seating was less than special. I would have preferred a booth or somewhere less trafficked."
03/13/2024,BarbaraT,5.0,Great service. Great food !   Would definitely go ag  again
03/11/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Always a treat going to eat at MJ’s.
Sarah is an amazing server !"
03/11/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Had the filet.  Cooked perfect. Super tender.  Our waiter Chris was fantastic.
03/10/2024,Tamara,5.0,The ambience is great. The service is top- notch. The waitress & waiters are  very attentive. Every seating area gives you a personalized feeling. The food is outstanding. I can’t wait to return. It’s definitely worth the expense.
03/09/2024,Lynn,4.0,"It was a busy March evening with all the events going on at Mohegan yet still, the food came out prompt and the great quality was maintained.  The service was impeccable!  Their famous corn was not on the menu as it was found to be a seasonable item.  The booths in the back are nice because it is more quiet than up front by the bar and restaurant entrance.  Request that on the reservation.  Overall, a great evening especially if you want to make an impression."
03/09/2024,conncat,1.0,"We were late in being seated by 20 minutes!

Hostess was dismissive and not very nice!"
03/08/2024,LynnC,3.0,"We had a waiter and an assistant, and had to remind them to get butter for our crab legs.  The water glasses went dry and we had to ask for refills on our drinks.  The meal was delicious, but when you are charging five star prices you expect five star service.  Thank you"
03/08/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"I frequent steakhouses in lower Fairfield County and NYC and must highlight the level of service we received yesterday. Our server, Chris, was so engaging and attentive without being overbearing. My boyfriend and I were celebrating his birthday and could not be happier about our choice of venue for dinner.

Good food is easy to fine, but noteworthy service is a little harder to come by nowadays. Thank you Chris, and others, for such a wonderful experience. It is greatly appreciated."
03/04/2024,KellyF,5.0,"The food was amazing, the service was great and loved the ambiance."
03/03/2024,JR87,5.0,"I really nice meal. Not one of those places that skates by on it's celebrity name, but the food was great, the steaks were nicely cooked, and the service was friendly and professional."
03/03/2024,JamesW,5.0,"Always wonderful! 
Danielle was terrific dining experience."
03/02/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We made a reservation for 4 walked in they Sat is right away, we had our main waitress and another waiter that would stop by refill the waters and take plates, very tentative. The four of use had a had a hard time deciding on what to get everything sound good in the end we went with the MVP steak flight and feed all four of use with out a problem, would high recommend the mash potato flight and Brussels sprouts, the cream spinach was also very good. Well worth the money, the only down side is could possibly say is it is a little dark in there. Could go on and on with the overall experience, every one that waited on us were very knowledgeable, all four of us agreed it was a great place and would go back again."
03/02/2024,BillE,5.0,FANTASTIC !! Can’t wait to return there for another outstanding meal
03/02/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We truly enjoyed ourselves and had a wonderful time. Our waiter Robert was great and he actually remembered serving us 2 years ago. We will definitely be back!!!
03/01/2024,PattyS,1.0,Came for the “surf and turf special for two.” Very disappointing. Ordered “medium” steak it was way too charred causing it to be bitter. Needed a microscope to find the lobster. VmSent back. Manger comped us one entree. NOT worth it.
03/01/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,One of the best meals we’ve ever had. Service was awesome.
03/01/2024,TimothyT,4.0,They were out of espresso vodka as they claimed that the machine was broken. Disappointed in that. Food very good though
02/27/2024,Vegas2015,5.0,"Service was excellent, the steaks are delicious.The drinks were great also."
02/27/2024,Daniel,5.0,Jordan’s is our go to place to commemorate any special occasion.  The food and service are outstanding. The tomahawk with the parmesean crust is amazing!
02/26/2024,NicoleD,5.0,This was our first time back on 20years. It was a great date night. The food was amazing but what made the night more enjoyable was our server Chris. He has a great personality and very engaged with his customers. We did not feel rushed at all.
02/26/2024,SydneyM,5.0,Simone was a great waitress and great recommendations for wine and menu options.
02/25/2024,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Good was very good. But $40 for a small crab cake was ridiculous
02/25/2024,AndrewF,5.0,Was definitely worthwhile. Definitely would go back. Food and atmosphere were both great
02/24/2024,Sophia,2.0,"We were right on time for our reservation that was made an month in advance but still had to stand waiting for 15 minutes until we were sat at the worst table right by the door where it was super loud. We asked to move, they let us. Everything was fine from there except when the check came the waitress rubbed my boyfriend’s chest and shoulder in front of me. She didn’t know I was the one paying and leaving her tip. I’ve been here multiple times before and never had a bad experience until this one."
02/24/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Our server was friendly and attentive. Food was absolutely amazing. Tomahawk for 2 special was cooked to perfection, and can’t ever go wrong with that garlic bread fondue appetizer!"
02/24/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,It’s always an amazing experience ! Great staff and great food!!
02/24/2024,BrianK,5.0,Upon arrival and confirmed our reservation we were seated proptly! Wait staff was very helpful and attentive! Food was cooked perfectly! Very pleasant over all dining experience!
02/24/2024,VincentB,1.0,"My waiter charged me 2 times for a tip 

I gave her cash tip and also there was a tip put on my receipt that I didn’t put in 

516 859 3264. Please contact me"
02/24/2024,GeorgeT,5.0,"Great service, ambiance and food.  Highly recommend."
02/23/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"I have to say our bartender, Brad, who served us while we waited for our reservation time (we were early) was extremely knowledgeable, warm, and really set the proverbial bar quite high for the evening as far as customer service and the experience of the visit itself. I plan on returning some time this year (the restaurant isn't a convenient distance from our home) because I want to try another dish he had recommended. (Or maybe I will just get several thousand orders of their garlic bread with the blue cheese cream sauce because that was a showstopper quite honestly!)"
02/22/2024,Holly,5.0,"the Top American Waygu T-Bone steak was delicious but not worth what you are selling it for, 150? it was very thin to be honest, could have been a bit thicker.  But everything else was great, I lied, that sauce on the asparagus was different, weird. But seriously everything else was great !! 

Thank you :)"
02/22/2024,AmandaK,5.0,"Food, drinks, and service were all outstanding! My husband and I shared the garlic bread appetizer, a Caesar salad, 10oz filet, an Italian sausage, side of seared scallops, mashed potato trio, Macaroni and cheese, and the layered cake. When we go again we will either get just the macaroni and cheese or potato trio instead of both. The sides are huge so take that into consideration. We both are foodies and can eat a lot but even sharing everything we felt we could have cut back so we wouldn’t have left overs. This place is a wonderful restaurant for a date night or for a nice night out with adult family members / friends."
02/22/2024,Bsalmon,5.0,Great food!!!!!!!!!! great service !!!!!!!!!10/10
02/21/2024,MarieP,4.0,Surprisingly the steaks  were not cooked the same.   X2 7oz filets mid-rare... one..perfection...juciy etc.  The other had to be resting for sometime.  Not one drop of juice and not terribly warm.
02/21/2024,hopeM,5.0,"Very pleasant,  the entire staff is on point.  Extremely organized,  you get what you pay for and Michael Jordan's Steakhouse is on point. I can't stress enough how well trained the staff is from the front of the house to the back! Thank you for a wonderful evening."
02/21/2024,MichaelT,5.0,The food was incredible! Service was amazing! Highly recommend!
02/21/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Amazing experience. Excellent food and service. We loved that we could split one of their larger pasta dishes as well. Absolutely will be back.
02/20/2024,RickyH,5.0,"Great service from the front door, to the service staff. Nice touch with the signed birthday card by several staff members for my wife's birthday. Thanks for the great evening."
02/20/2024,nami,5.0,"I go for the filet, my wife does the sea food. Although I visit several times a year it's always my birthday treat."
02/19/2024,RHODEB,5.0,"Our server, Kate was an absolute joy. She was so hyper! But in a very very good way. The food was stupendous! Worth every dollar we spent - expensive but there’s a reason for that."
02/19/2024,EdwardM,3.0,I’ve been there a few times. I didn’t think the steak was nearly as good as it use to be. I ordered an appetizer and asked the waiter if it was what I thought and it was completely different. It was good but not worth the money.
02/19/2024,StephC,5.0,"The staff is always so friendly and the service is amazing. The food is outstanding! We come here once a year and feel that this restaurant blows any steakhouse out of the water by far! The drinks are always so good. Would recommend this to anyone, hands down!"
02/18/2024,KINGxLOU,5.0,"Great experience overall! We went for the first time on Michael's birthday. Food was amazing and the service was good. It is a little pricey, not absurd but  I still feel the Food and the experience were worth it. I would recommend and revisit!"
02/18/2024,JoeM,5.0,Food is always outstanding service is outstanding as well.  Look forward to our next visit.
02/18/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We came here to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary. When we were seated our waitress, Danielle, surprised us with a champagne toast to celebrate and an anniversary card signed by all the staff. It was sweet. The service, the food, and the ambiance were all amazing! As busy as they were for a holiday weekend, we never felt rushed or forgotten about one bit!"
02/18/2024,AnthonyC,5.0,"Never a bad meal/experience! We go all the time for special occasions. Drinks are great, food is great, service is ways what you want it to be! always would recommend!"
02/17/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,I have never had a bad meal here.  It is always delicious and the our waitress was great!
02/17/2024,SandyL,5.0,First time there! Amazing food.  Great service.  Loved our waitress.  We left feeling so full. No dessert 😕 next time.

02/17/2024,Mr860,5.0,First time here and let me just say everything ordered was phenomenal and every staff member was very friendly. Definitely will be back again
02/17/2024,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Good food. Kind of overrated and overpriced. Definitely not a fine dining steakhouse like I was expecting
02/16/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Our waiter Chris was wonderful very friendly and personable.  Great atmosphere food was awesome
02/16/2024,RM07,5.0,Great service and fantastic food. Oscar style was a $40 upcharge but so much crab meat and bearnaise sauce was given it didn't even matter.
02/16/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Our waiter Chris was very good & helpful. Excellent experience will dine again for sure.
02/16/2024,nellakh,3.0,"We usually went to this restaurant on the weekend and service was always impeccable.  This time, it was Thursday.  Dirty dishes were piled up on our table while we were served desert!  Water glasses were empty and not refilled!  For the amount of money we spent on this dinner I expected perfect service!  Not pleasant!"
02/15/2024,MelissaG,5.0,"Fantastic service, food, and environment. We plan on returning."
02/15/2024,JimF,5.0,"Our server Nikki was outstanding. Water service was great (sorry we didn’t get her name,) and GM who came to table was attentive.

This is the best food and service around. Enjoy!"
02/15/2024,Nick,5.0,"Fantastic meal!! Beautiful restaurant, great service. Our server Jen was personable and made us feel right at home. Really enjoyed the meal and will be back."
02/15/2024,Eddie,5.0,Overall great experience we will return again soon.
02/15/2024,OpenTable Diner,2.0,Have been numerous times in the past and had no issues but it’s been years since we have been. We went on Valentine’s Day this year and the food was terrible. Service was ok but not great. I don’t see myself picking this restaurant again.
02/14/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Was great as always!   Love Michael Jordan’s!  Service and quality of food  outstanding!
02/14/2024,TrishD,5.0,Service excellent food phenomenal. Kate and Katie were amazing.
02/14/2024,JaneL,5.0,"We used to go cedars steakhouse,  
for years and they changed hands and and everything got a lot more expensive. The staff is still very friendly but the experience is not there no more sad to say, which then we had to look for someplace new and then I found MJ 23 steakhouse took her there the first time on her birthday.

 (you was running the tomahawk special that night, and we ordered it. It was fantastic and  cooked to perfection.)

 now that is her favorite place to go so on Valentine’s Day I surprised her .
She have a fantastic time .


Thank you 
MJ 23 steakhouse to you and your fantastic staff
You will be seeing use lots more ."
02/13/2024,Molly,5.0,My husband and I highly recommend Michael Jordan Steakhouse! The food is fantastic. The service is excellent!
02/13/2024,Danesha,5.0,The food was very tasty and the service is the reason I would return.
02/13/2024,MichaelR,5.0,"World class steak at a price that is not only affordable, I would have paid twice the cost and still felt I was getting a great deal. Food was delicious. Melt in your mouth, food coma inducing. Service was excellent! This is my second time coming here, last time was 10 years ago, and it was virtually the same experience. I will not wait 10 years to come back! Take note competitors, this is how you run a restaurant."
02/12/2024,JohnK,5.0,"Great service, amazing food. Clearly a splurge evening, but worth it."
02/12/2024,CaliM,4.0,Went to MJs steakhouse in Mohegan with my boyfriend and parents to celebrate my birthday. The food was delicious and recieved a free birthday dessert (last time we also got champagne just not this time). Lighting was a little dark but the ambiance overall was nice.
02/11/2024,MaureenF,3.0,A disappointing experience last night. We’ve enjoyed the Porterhouse in the past but this time it was flavorless and not as tender as it should have been.  The broccoli salad was mushy and overdressed. The dinner rolls had been reheated or sat out too long. The service was very good.
02/11/2024,AleishaS,5.0,First time visiting and I will be back food was amazing. Crab cakes NO imitation crab honey REAL CRAB MEAT lol. Garlic bread whattttttt ! With the fondu sauce AMAZE BALLS ‼️ thank you .
02/11/2024,Triplemom,4.0,Simone was a terrific server!! She got our orders right and continued to check back on us.  She really made the night nice!
02/10/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Fast and friendly service. The restaurant is a little dark for my taste, but the food was outstanding."
02/10/2024,EricW,5.0,the staff was friendly as soon as we walked in.  Waitress was super friendly. Food was amazing
02/10/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Per usual, our experience was amazing. Our waitress was very sweet and checked on us multiple times. My boyfriend and I have been to MJ’s steak house multiple times and every time is perfect!! Always recommend to friends who are at Mohegan for the day."
02/10/2024,EdgarM,5.0,"Everything was great. Food, service ambience. We ordered filet mignon with mash potatoes, salmon with rice, green salad and garlic bread. Can’t emphasize enough how everything was so delicious!"
02/10/2024,LovingVegas2014,5.0,"I took my husband there for his birthday last evening as he is sort of steak snob. The staff immediately greeted him with a birthday card, which he loved. Our server was very attentive and friendly, the food was amazing and cooked perfectly (as always). We had the garlic bread and crab cake to start (best crab cake ever!) then we shared a steak flight with mac & cheese and potato trio for sides (with extra left to take home)…for dessert we ordered the chocolate layer cake to go our server delivered it with a candle!!! Everything from start to end was top notch! We highly recommend MJ Steak House for any special occasion or just a fabulous night out."
02/10/2024,Bbsmith,4.0,"i had the pasta with the braised beef, the presentation was not good it seemed messy the flavor was good, but I couldn't finish it was very heavy it was more like meat with pasta than pasta with meat."
02/10/2024,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"All of our steaks were way over cooked and dry! Luckily the service was great, but the food not so much!"
02/10/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Food was great. Atmosphere was great. Next time I’d like a booth.
02/09/2024,JenniferT,5.0,Delicious as usual. The class casino appetizer special  was really good.
02/09/2024,Meghan,5.0,Always exceeds our expectations.  The garlic bread is the best.
02/09/2024,SarahB,5.0,Excellent first experience. Next level service and food quality. Our waiter Chris was excellent. Will definitely be back.
02/08/2024,MichaelH,5.0,We come to MJ 's Steakhouse at least once a month. It's the only restaurant I've been to in the last ten years where consistency is the name of the game. Have not had a bad meal in the past seven months
02/07/2024,sara,5.0,"Great meal. Great service, food is always fresh and delicious"
02/07/2024,JudsonH,4.0,"Excellent food, great service. Was a quiet Wednesday night, but I'm sure it get much busier. Just hit at a good time."
02/07/2024,Lovtoeat,5.0,Great service and great food knowledgeable staff Ambiance
02/04/2024,sam1023,5.0,Thank you Nick. Always an amazing dining experience at Michael Jordan’s.
02/04/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Brian , our server was great………………………………………………………."
02/04/2024,Sean,5.0,"Aside from a few small nitpicks, everything about our dinner was great. Our waitress was fantastic, and the food was superb as always. My only 2 issues were 1. The lighting was a bit dark, which caused several older customers use their phone flashlights to read the menu which got a bit annoying when they would shine it everywhere. 2. The NY strip is amazing, however on the ends the fat chars a bit leaving a not so pleasant taste. Other than that, everything was great and I will be back again for sure."
02/03/2024,JohnB,5.0,"My Shrimp Cocktail was OK,it could have been a little more firmer and Flavorfull,My 7oz Filet Mignon was outstanding ,cooked perfectly medium the service i recieved from Simone was absolutely Outstanding,Simone was Kind,Courteuos and helpful in my choosing the degree i wanted my steak cooked and did all this with a SMILE!"
02/03/2024,ElizabethD,4.0,"Always good food & service, also always too loud. Can not hear your dinner guests talk"
02/03/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Exceptionally delicious food with great service!!!
02/03/2024,Wash,2.0,We have eaten at Michael Jordan’s on many occasions. We were greatly disappointed with the hostess and hostesses who treated our reservation like a giant inconvenience. We were asked if we wanted to sit at the bar. When we checked in we were told they were clearing tables and weren’t seated for another 15 minutes. The waiter seemed preoccupied with the bigger tables he had.
02/03/2024,PaulH,5.0,We got our table on time with our reservation. Service was fast and informative. The food was excellent. The atmosphere was amazing and an experience that you have to be there for. I will be back.
02/03/2024,Dave,5.0,"Best steak I’ve ever had!  Go for the American Wagu strip, it’s amazing!"
02/03/2024,Robert,4.0,"Great dinner for my wife’s birthday. Staff was excellent, service was speedy."
02/03/2024,Richk,3.0,"Michael Jordan’s steakhouse was good but definitely not great. The best part of the meal was the appetizers. We orders the crab cake and chicken skewers. Both were incredible!  For our main course we ordered the 10oz fillet and the American wagyu strip. While both were cooked perfect, they both were just missing something. Probably could have gone with the cheaper NY strip and been the same. Over all nice place just an over priced for what we were served."
02/02/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We had a fabulous dinner with a fabulous waiter, and I would definitely go back!"
02/02/2024,Sasha,4.0,"Steak was overcooked, medium rare was medium well, expected a better quality. Desert was delicious though"
02/01/2024,GenaS,4.0,"My first time at this restaurant. Food was delicious, lighting was poor for area we were seated but overall a great place."
02/01/2024,JPgerardp,5.0,"The atmosphere, as well as the service was impeccable. The food was absolutely outstanding, and they treated my wife like a queen, because it was her birthday and bought her out a free dessert, which was much appreciated. Would highly recommended to anybody staying at Mohegan."
01/31/2024,BonnieD,5.0,"Who is the genius that changed your rolls?  Terrible, terrible  last time I was there I complained how they resembled brown and serve rolls from a diner.  This time brown and serve rolls with glaze on them.  Your original rolls were wonderful these rolls take away from the dinner."
01/30/2024,kevinA,5.0,Service was great.  And the meal was amazing.  Great celebration dinner for my wife's birthday… Thanks
01/29/2024,Teep17,5.0,"We had a fabulous time! The food was superb and waiter couldn’t do enough for us.
I would go back any time I m at Mohegan Sun."
01/28/2024,DonaldS,5.0,"Everything was awesome. Our waitress was outstanding,  she was very informative and helpful.  The food was cooked to perfection. I  had the flight 23 and it was spectacular."
01/28/2024,RosalieB,5.0,Always amazing. Never a disappointment. We asked for our waiter Chris but couldn’t have. Melissa came to the table and made sure we were not disappointed. Amazing food and staff as always
01/27/2024,Mewhoeats,5.0,Great food. Wonderful service. Will be eating here again.
01/27/2024,RobertS,5.0,Great experience. Great food. Price point a little high but overall it was a great dinner.
01/26/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food and service were fabulous.  Especially our host Marcus.  Very attentive and friendly!
01/26/2024,JamesC,5.0,Food was great as usual and the service was extraordinary.

01/25/2024,Foodie,5.0,Fantastic! Great food and service!  Will return. Thanks!
01/24/2024,DavidS,5.0,"My husband and I had the Tomahawk Steak and it was wonderful.  We ordered salads and a side of asparagus which was great, but the salads were so large and tasty that it was impossible for us to finish it.  We will be back!"
01/23/2024,JohnY,5.0,"Awesome food,service and ambience. Our server, Janine was outstanding"
01/22/2024,MichaelH,5.0,We have been coming to MJ's Steakhouse for years.  The Hot food is served hot and the cold is served cold.  The staff is always very pleasant and efficient.  The hidden gem-Steak frites.  Sirloin steak with the flavor of sirloin and the tenderness of a filet.
01/22/2024,MarieB,5.0,The experience was great. Everything we ate was delicious
01/22/2024,TrishD,4.0,"We went for the Tomahawk, and although good lacked flavor. The Kansas City strip was actually amazing with better flavor.  Garlic bread delish and the couscous that they serve with the chicken dish excellent. Short rib pasta is also a winner."
01/22/2024,DavidC,5.0,I've been coming to this steak house every time I visit Mohegan Sun. Pricing is reasonable for what the quality you receive.  Service is always good. They even offered a complimentary dessert for a birthday gift. I appreciate the attention to the details.
01/22/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,First time dining in your establishment. We were celebrating Our Anniversary and made my reservation through OpenTable. My Host and Hostess were delightful they accommodated us with a booth seating. It was a great choice for a romantic setting. My waiter Nick was astounding at his job so respectable and very knowledgeable on the menu. He provides great suggestions and was always checking on the table. He even up sold us to a great new red wine that we never had before it was delicious. The bread for the table is butter yet sweet and you definitely can’t stop eating it. Since it was the first day of Restaurant week we decided to purchase from that menu. We had the 42 Tomahawk Steak with fries for $99. We ordered the oysters and the Caesar salad with a side of chimichurri sauce for the steak. We will be coming back for Valentine’s Day. Thank you for a memorable Birthday Dinner.
01/21/2024,RaquelM,5.0,"The service was excellent,  server was knowledgeable and helpful in narrowing down decisions. The timing of food arriving to the table was great and the food itself was extraordinary. The flavors were so bold and worth the price. Ordered the seabass and it melted in your mouth. Also ordered the NY strip and it was very tender. I would highly recommend eating here."

01/19/2024,karynl,4.0,Awesome meal for my man’s birthday! I felt as if we were being rushed out of there because they were so many people waiting and I had made reservations. I don’t think we should be rushed.

01/15/2024,LarryM,5.0,"We had a very good meal, great service, nice people. We will be back!"
01/15/2024,AlexJ,4.0,"Service wasn't as good as expected, took a long time between servings.
Desert menu been reduced, not many choices.  Main waiter needed to follow up with us more frequently, it wasn't busy.  The back server did more for us than the main waiter.
Maybe give 4 rolls instead of 3 for 2 patrons.  Main Porterhouse entry was what was expected."
01/15/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Favorite restaurant in Connecticut great food, staff and vibe. Highly recommend!"
01/14/2024,Mario,5.0,The food and services were excellent. My wife and I asked if we could make  a change to part of the meal with another item. The change was made with no additional cost and the results were excellent. We highly recommend Michael Jordan’s.
01/14/2024,CurtisM,5.0,"Steaks were cooked to perfect temperature. NY strip was excellent. Our server was excellent as well. Too expensive for a daily or weekly thing, but great for a special occasion."

01/14/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Food was just OK. Drinks were presented well. Service was great, and they took our reservation early."
01/13/2024,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Impeccable service and attention to our needs. Nikki answered all questions very thoroughly. Wife and I had 2 apps along with soup on menu and shared one entre. Apps were very good served hot and within a very good timeframe.  Soup was not our favorite. Unique flavor. Entre was Chilean sea bass. Fish it self was tasty.  Very poor presentation.  It was uncharacteristic for an upscale establishment to let that dish be served that way. No creativity. Fish sat on a bed of risotto and that’s it. Lacked style. Needs drastic improvement.  Disappointing!
01/13/2024,Marian,5.0,Delicious food and excellent service. Highly recommended.
01/13/2024,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"It was extremely dark in the restaurant and we as very expensive. The food was very good, pricing to be expected as it’s inside the casino. Not a great place for kids."

01/12/2024,JeffH,3.0,"The restaurant was rather loud. I ordered the Wagyu Sirloin which was good but not amazing as I had hoped.  Prices were very high compared to other high end steak houses.  The service was very good.  
Overall I would say the meal was good but didn’t knock my socks off.  One and done for me."

Garlic Bread App - UNREAL. Cheese fondue…woah

01/04/2024,EllaP,5.0,"We had a feast and it was all so delicious!!! We always have our favorite new york strip steak. The garlic spreads like butter and adds another level of flavor, YUM! Tried the pork and salmon, both were delicious and perfectly cooked. Added the brussel sprouts and mac and cheese, perfect addition! Took home the broccoli and arugula salad, its amazing. 

Definitely over ate but worth it! Love the rolls as well with the sweet glaze, so nice and airy! 

Martinis and spirit free drinks, taste so fresh and delicious. You can  tell those making them really know!

As usual, service was great! Rolando is also absolutely amazing! He is on top of it all, great personality and so pleasant! 

Looking forward to the next visit, thank you all!"

01/01/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We were seated after 10 minutes to a table by the window where we people watched as we sipped our cocktails and chatted. Our server Janine was helpful, knowledgeable and attentive to whatever we needed. The porterhouse for 2 was cooked to perfection along with a wedge salad and loaded baked potato. For dessert we split the 23 layer chocolate cake that was to die for with cappuccinos. We had a phenomenal meal to ring in 2024. Would definitely go back again."
01/01/2024,OpenTable Diner,5.0,No complaints always an amazing experience.  Our favorite place to eat

She made us feel very much at home and even though it was New Years Eve and she was very buy, we never felt neglected or rushed. Everyone who came to the table was willing to help in any way they could. The food was fabulous. We’re looking forward to returning often. Bravo to Michael Jordan’s!"

12/30/2023,LexyL,5.0,The steaks were amazing. The drinks were amazing. They had a fun kids menu with coloring. The staff was attentive and kind. We brought our 6 and 4 year old for a nice dinner before a show at Mohegan and it was an excellent experience. I would definitely go back!
12/30/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Wonderful place for dining! Couldn’t have asked for better service and above all top class food!
12/30/2023,JessicaS,5.0,"Absolutely the most phenomenal steak I’ve ever had. My husband and I split the aged tomahawk steak for 2. We are debating going back for another and it hasn’t even been 24 hours 😂😂. The service was also fast and efficient. We go here every time we are at Mohegan, and that will never change! Cannot recommend enough. 
Even the sports bar side is wonderful!"
12/30/2023,DonnaW,2.0,"Clearly Michael Jordan’s has scaled down on their quality replacing quality for cost effectiveness.  As always we ordered a martini with blue cheese filled olives.  The olives tasted like dried feta cheese. When we asked our waitress if they were indeed blue cheese she said yes but no longer do they stuff fresh cheese into the olives because it was too expensive, instead they buy jarred blue cheese olives. Now we all know those jarred cheese olives are tasteless. For a steakhouse - an expensive one at that - it’s unfathomable they cannot afford to prepare their own olives beforehand. Secondly they used to have a delicious bread basket. Now it’s two SWEET rolls brushed with a shiny coat of butter.  Horrible. We ordered the Peruvian chicken skewers - they were tasteless.  Sadly the chipotle roasted corn they used to have on their menu is no longer available.  Thankfully we ordered the porterhouse for two - thankfully that  was the only delicious part of our meal.   

Sometimes it’s best not to make changes and especially scaling down quality of items to cheaper tasteless versions."
12/30/2023,Nina,4.0,The steak extravaganza flight was the right amount of meat for 2 healthy men without being too large.
12/30/2023,JimT,4.0,service was great  we went for your anniversary  .
12/29/2023,MichaelZ,5.0,"Everything was great from start to finish!  Jenn was great, food runners were on their game and Barry Fortin, general manager, checked in on us a couple times to make sure everything was perfect and it was!!

12/29/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Pros: wonderful staff, excellent food
Cons: Can’t get through on the phone to make reservations; mixed drink hard barely any alcohol in it."
12/29/2023,Foodie,5.0,Salmon and Filet Mignon were fantastic! Service is always top notch. Very pleased with our restaurant experience.
12/28/2023,ScottT,4.0,It was a great experience for all of us especially my father in law 70th birthday
12/28/2023,RaymondC,4.0,"We’ve dined here several times. This trip we had the 7 oz. Fillet and double cut lamb chops with sides of Brussels sprouts, arugula salad and garlic bread. The meats were cooked as ordered and delicious, however the sprouts were underwhelming, salad plain and couscous that came with the lamb chops bland. At these prices one would expect to be very pleased.
Noise level was tolerable; there’s always one or two patrons who, due to alcohol or character, need to be the loudest, most obnoxious in the house.
The high point was our server, who was both helpful and personable, as were the house managers.
Would recommend with reservations."
12/27/2023,MadisonK,5.0,Definitely worth it. Our waitress was great. Food was delicious. Couldn't have asked for a better meal.

12/15/2023,FeliciaP,5.0,"Just recently moved to Connecticut for hubby’s job change and we wanted to take the woman and her husband who really helped him get his dream job out to dinner. The hosts and hostesses were extremely friendly and welcoming. We were seated at a booth which was nice because it was a bit loud in there. We started of with cocktails and the bacon appetizer which was very good. My husband and I had the Filet’s and both were cooked to perfection. Our guests had the porterhouse for two and said it was so tender and delicious. We ordered roasted mushrooms (my favorite, so yummy with the garlic aioli sauce), mashed potato trio (very creamy and savory) and the macaroni and cheese ( I did not partake in this because I just couldn’t get enough of the mushrooms but everyone said it was very good) . Our server was very helpful, friendly and on top of everything. Now that we live less than a half hour away, we plan on going back often. I highly  recommend this restaurant."
12/15/2023,DonB,5.0,Outstanding service and food best we ever had anywhere
12/14/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"My husband and I dined here on a Wednesday 12/13/23 for our anniversary !!  We were greeted by both of the hosts and accommodated very quickly. We had a reservation and they notified us that a booth would be ready if we’d rather that for more of an intimate dining experience, which is extremely nice! Our waitress name was Jennifer, who was very accommodating and patient as we haven’t had a date night in a very long time, so making a decision as what we were deciding on for our meal was a little tricky.
For appetizers we ordered 1/2 dozen oysters which my husband was so excited by the Minette and temperature of the oysters!  We also had the Nueske’s  double smoked bacon which was amazing as wel!
For our entrées we had the American Wagyu strip, and the MJ’s USDA Prime Delmonico with sides of the loaded baked potatoe (which was definitely LOADED!)  Jennifer was the best waitress and was wonderful! We will be back!!"
12/13/2023,NewtownBobby,5.0,"On time and guided to the exact table we requested. Staff introduced themselves and served us well for almost 90 minutes of Dining.
Had NO steak, 2 fish dinners that were 4 stars. Generous drinks and fresh Bread.
One of our favorite places to dine."
12/13/2023,TristinaW,3.0,"The restaurant is overall a nice establishment.
The staff were very nice and the customer service was great. The food was very oily and greasy and was not good at all."
12/12/2023,GarryL,5.0,Had another excellent meal at Michael Jordan's last night - The steak was cooked perfectly and the Key Lime Pie was outstanding. My server Chris takes care of everything in a knowledgeable and professional manner and is very friendly. The whole wait staff did an outstanding job and  the manager checked with me tableside to see if everything was to my liking. I really love dining here !
12/12/2023,SteveZ,4.0,Steak I had was over very hard over cooked not that much flavor service was excellent.

12/10/2023,DavidM,5.0,"The food was excellent, and the steaks were done to perfection ￼"
12/10/2023,paml,3.0,"We’ve been here before and we were surprised at how over dressed our salads and side dishes were.  Next time everything will be ordered on the side.  But, the least enjoyable part of our meal were our steaks. Our Bone In Ribeye and 10oz Filet Mignon were Both over salted.  And the filet had a ton of pepper on the outside that my mouth was on fire.  We mentioned it to our server, but there wasn’t anything to be done at that time since it was probably 15 mins since we were served till she checked in.  So definitely not worth the value/price if the steak isn’t cooked perfectly"
12/10/2023,Rosie,5.0,Our overall experience was excellent. We were celebrating our anniversary and requested a quiet table. We sat before pur reservation time at a quiet booth.  The service was excellent and the food was amazing. Beat steak we ever had and we have been to many steak houses.
12/09/2023,Squigley,5.0,Food amazing!  Service great very enjoyable  night
12/09/2023,DonS,4.0,"Although we had a reservation, we still needed to wait for 15 minutes to be seated. Once seated we waited another 20 minutes for the server to greet us. She immediately apologized for the confusion or something. The food was amazing, as always. That is truly the reason we return. There was a glitch with the computer system, so although the server tried, she could not verify our rewards to use for the bill, which was extremely disappointing."
12/09/2023,Elle,5.0,"Awesome experience. Food was amazing -  had the filet - cooked perfectly. Garlic bread was delicious!
Service was great - cool atmosphere."
12/09/2023,JohnM,5.0,Excellent experience all around.  Great and caring staff.  We had a wonderful time and the everything we had was amazing.

12/09/2023,CHRISTYA,5.0,Perfect! Everything was absolutely perfection.  I would absolutely recommend this restaurant.
12/09/2023,Lambchopporky,5.0,Michael Jordan’s at Mohegan sun great place to enjoy. The service is outstanding. They really cater to you. I had a filet minion with asparagus. Melts in your mouth. My friends had  the salmon misto. They loved it. Key lime pie for dessert. Delicious. My lemon drop martini was perfect. Enjoy
12/09/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,It was a great experience all the way around!  We enjoyed it very much!

12/09/2023,MelanieM,5.0,"Fantastic service, delicious food- can’t wait to go back!"
12/09/2023,DarrinC,3.0,"Michaels Jordan used to be our favorite restaurant, We, for years said we never had a bad meal but how things have turned. Tomahawk steak was on our previous visit, it was horrible. Color of steak was way off  can not really understand how they get away with this.  This past visit we both had the Delmonico which we have always loved. Steak seemed, to have different textures, the sauce was totally different than what we have been used to. Caesar salad sucks, go back to your old way of making caesar salad. I have said to my wife that because of whats going on in the world they probably are not getting the good cuts of meat like they use to. Those are going to the oligarchs of our country. Two years ago my wife and I took our cousin and husband out for birthday dinner, we spent over seven hundred dollars for 4 of us. Waitress bring out our leftovers while we waited for desert. Guess where she put our leftovers, ON THE FLOOR. Maybe because thats where their food belongs. Food is not worth the money. Might give this place another chance in a couple years but I highly doubt it."
12/09/2023,Mlcap53,5.0,"Exceptional service.
Steak & Lobster special for two = marvelous.
Truffled fries = to die for
Old Fashioned cocktail = wonderful.
Overall a great steakhouse"
12/08/2023,KimW,5.0,"My children found their new favorite special restaurant! We had a fantastic meal at Michael Jordan’s Steakhouse last night prior to the Straight No Chaser show. The service was impeccable and the food was outstanding. My husband and son shared the tomahawk steak special and it was cooked perfectly rare. My daughter said the salmon was the best she has ever had. We also had oysters, and the Peruvian chicken appetizer. I had a nice and fresh salad with half a lobster and the roasted brussel sprouts. Everything was wonderful and it was the perfect place for a special night out to celebrate the holidays!"
12/08/2023,Bernz,5.0,The service was outstanding.  The noise was quiet at first but understandably got louder as the place filled up.  The presentation is wonderful but the table felt a bit small with all the orders on it.  The only real drawback is the expense.
12/07/2023,JCat,5.0,Service and food were both excellent - you have to try the garlic bread!
12/06/2023,GeraldL,5.0,"The food, service and atmosphere were fantastic.  My Wife and I were celebrating our 50th Wedding Anniversary and we were treated to a complimentary glass of champagne and a card signed by the restaurant staff.  The gesture was very nice and unexpected."

This is our 4th year coming to MJ's for our anniversary dinner.

Thank You all for a great time!!!

12/03/2023,MichaelI,2.0,"I have enjoyed almost every dining experience that I have had over many years as we have spent both my wife's and my birthdays there annually as well as other dinners with family & friends.  This last experience was most disappointing !  While we had gotten the seating arrangements as requested, the service was poor, especially in comparison to our past experiences.  Generally there are even some intriguing ""specials"" on the menu - but nothing exciting this visit.  There was no follow up on simply refilling water, drink needs and total table service.  Ninigret oysters were shucked with broken shell and little almost no meat - the smallest meatless oysters I have ever been served at a restaurant.  The steak (generally most enjoyable) had an unusual aroma and flavor.  The desert menu was extremely limited in comparison to our past experiences there, especially on birthday celebrations.  Frankly, our most disappointing dining experience to Michael Jordan's in years - Almost was like there was a significant change in management ????  Makes me uncertain whether I'd continue to recommend them to a friend at this time."
12/03/2023,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Steak was way over cooked, they did take it off the bill,our crab cake was alot smaller then the last time we had it All the sides were very good"
12/02/2023,EugeniaS,5.0,"This was an absolute awesome experience.  The appetizers, garlic bread with blue cheese fondu and the eggplant so yummy.  We also ordered the porterhouse for two with the mash potato trio which was finger licking good.  The Chianti wine we ordered was also so smooth.  This was a great night and we are definitely coming back."
12/02/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"A great anniversary meal! Blue cheese fondue and meatball apps to share, shrimp rigatoni a la vodka for me and steak frites for the boys...all delicious. I brought half home and my son and I each got the 23 layer cake
.
Also brought half home a piece...but delicious! Our waitress was lovely and her assistant too. We appreciated the glasses of champagne given to us for our celebration. nice to have the manager check in too.

Just wish we'd gotten a booth instead of a table for six for our party of three....but it had a view out the window so enjoyed people watching.

A very pleasant evening!"
12/01/2023,KimG,5.0,"It was exceptional from start to finish!  It was my Mom’s 90th birthday and they made it so special for her!  From the service to the best waiter to the delicious food….Can’t wait to go back on our next visit!

11/26/2023,PATRICIAC,4.0,We waited outside restaurant because our table wasn’t ready. Although we were on time. After 20 minutes I went back in and indeed they forgot us. We were tired and that was disappointing. Our waitress Simone was excellent. The food was all great except for the steak. It was ok but certainly not great. Will not come again.
11/26/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We love everything about Michael Jordan’s Steak House. A nice wine list. Awesome food choices. The best filet mignon .. perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked! We will be back!!
11/26/2023,GinaM,3.0,"Our server, Jennifer, was a gem…. Our Wagyu strip steaks were definitely not worth the price."
11/26/2023,TinaB,4.0,My steak was excellent but my husband's scallops had an odd flavor.

Both enjoyed the food with much leftovers.  My ribeye was cooked to my preference and delicious.  When we sat down at our table, I told the waitress that we were celebrating her 87th birthday.  Too my surprise at the end of our meal, they came back and gave her a birthday dessert with a candle on it.  What a surprise!"
11/24/2023,JohnD,4.0,Both our steaks were luke warm and the seared scallops cold.
11/24/2023,JohnL,5.0,"This is our fifth time back at Michael Jordan’s. Today we had the Friday special surf and turf, which is a tomahawk steak with Bernaise. The Bernaise was filled with of lobster or crab meat.

Quite the delicious steak. we were here to celebrate our daughter’s birthday. They made it special for her. We were greeted with a birthday card and during dessert time they gave her a complimentary brownie with ice cream crumble. ￼

You really appreciate the attention given to us by our waiter and the wait staff were attentive and professional."
11/24/2023,KaitlinW,5.0,"Our first experience and won’t be our last! Food was delicious, service was outstanding!"
11/24/2023,RichardM,5.0,"At first we were disappointed with our seats, then we sat down and took in the aura of Michael Jordan's steakhouse, there was a bar, we could see the raw bar and also the kitchen.  I noticed that the raw bar attendant was really picking about his station, he made an order then wiped down everything and everywhere prior to starting the next.  Very meticulous about his work.  The food cam out and we were extremely pleased with presentation, taste and over appearance.  The meal was great and I would recommend the dessert was wonderful a 23 layer cake, it is a must try, however I challenge you to finish it, we shared it and took it home and ate the rest later that evening.  Overall a great experience."
11/23/2023,RhondaS,5.0,The service and good were outstanding. My family and I enjoyed our dinner very much.
11/23/2023,gymgirl,5.0,Amazing restaurant from the front desk to the servers. Food is top notch. One of the best restaurants we have ever been to and we go out a lot.We will be back again.
11/23/2023,Beachgirl,3.0,"The food was wonderful but not hot.  Waiter rushed us to order and the restaurant was very dark, we had to use our cells to see menu! 
I would return but will have to make sure food is hot!  It spoiled our dinner experience at the restaurant. It was our first time there. Delious tasting food, Too Bad"
11/23/2023,Lovie,3.0,"Was there for thanksgiving with the family. Thought at first it was inclusive dinner, arrived to find out everything was a la carte. Okay…food was delicious, added some sides, we were able to order off reg menu too which was nice. 
We enjoyed our dinner, but felt kinda rushed along once we were eating. I get it, you want to turn over the table, but this was thanksgiving and we met family there from out of town and it would have been nice to not have been rushed though it."
11/23/2023,Nelle,5.0,"this was our 2nd Thanksgiving there. The holiday special was like a homecooked meal. 
Our guests were delighted. 1 of our guests had a filet mignon & was very pleased. It was cooked to perfection. Service was terrific. My husband & I eat there on occasion & sit at the bar. Drinks are always great, especially the martinis, as our guests learned yesterday. We highly recommend."
11/23/2023,nhus0410,5.0,"The food was good. Not exceptional. Your server was wonderful. Can’t remember her name, sorry"
11/23/2023,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"The food was very salty, from the appetizers to the Dinner. We sent back a dish only for it to come back still salty, the service is outstanding but the food mediocre"
11/22/2023,Foodie,5.0,Our new favorite spot! Food and service are outstanding! The raw bar sampler plate is awesome!
11/20/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Wonderful food, great staff, very positive experience"
11/19/2023,Joffrey,3.0,Steak was ok. My opinion overpriced.  Can't compare to Ruth's in my opinion.  I believe if you walk in with a 2 person party you don't get the service you would with a larger party
11/19/2023,Tucker,5.0,"the wait staff are excellent and professional..the food is consistently very tasty and cooked properly,, the seating and ambience is also very nice...probably one of the best resturants in the entire sttate of CT"
11/19/2023,JESdiner,4.0,"This traditional steakhouse - with city prices to match - does a very nice job overall. I dined here with 3 teenager boys after a basketball tournament and was encouraged to purchase one of the carnivorous “family style” platters, which range in price from $150 to over $300. Many pounds of meat and no sides, which might appeal to some but wasn’t really our thing. We kept our meal low key and still topped off at almost $300 with one cocktail and no dessert. Be prepared to spend some cash but you will have a nice meal with adept service."
11/19/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Our entire experience was wonderful from start to finish. The hostess was friendly and welcoming. Our server, Simone was top notch! She was warm, personable, prompt and extremely knowledgeable about the menu, being able to answer any and all questions. Everything we ordered from cocktails to apps to entrees & sides was absolutely incredible. We will definitely be back!"
11/19/2023,Drewbster,3.0,Everything was great but the steak was mediocre. Great place for a date if you’re vegan.
11/19/2023,CarlosS,5.0,Wonderful 20 out of 10. I would come back 100 times.
11/18/2023,CassandraHairchick,5.0,"Went for our anniversary yesterday. Wonderful experience. Service was impeccable. We even got a card wishing us a happy anniversary, nice touch. Drinks were delish. Food was outstanding, my husband and I both had steak… cooked to perfection. We also had the Mac n cheese and Brussel sprouts…. Best we’ve ever had!!! Wish there was this restaurant in NY! We will de be back next time we’re at Mohegan!"
11/18/2023,JonathanC,5.0,The food was great and the service was awesome. Great first experience
11/18/2023,AlmaM,5.0,"Food was great!  The server was excellent and overall great dinner experience.  Love to celebrate special occasions there, they really make it a memorable time!"
11/17/2023,Sheckie,3.0,"We've had some great meals at steak houses without ordering the steak so we had high expectations. The oysters were tiny, not really worth it.
I has sea bass. It was good but would have better better served with a miso sauce to make it lighter. The risotto was good but not great, especially when you consider the price. My wife had the short rib pasta. I thought it was a heavy meal.  My host picked up the meal but if you are buying, there are better choices for the money."
11/15/2023,Bleebr,5.0,"It was a wonderful birthday celebration! Cocktails, delicious! Wait staff, impeccable! Food that makes you want to come back and do it all over again! Plenty of delicious gluten free options!!!"

11/12/2023,KatZG16,5.0,Service is everything! Jeanine did not disappoint with her energetic zest and found us an amazing wine choice that so perfectly complimented a wonderful sea bass dish. Was definitely a great choice for our anniversary. And the personally signed card was a very nice gesture. Thank you so much for helping make our night so special. :)
11/11/2023,KevinC,4.0,Front desk obnoxious after service went way up in quality. Shrimp cocktail two steps above bait food. If this was Applebees I would give it five star but expected way more
11/11/2023,AshleyL,2.0,"To be honest I had a hard time with the fact that both my filet and my husband's ribeye were over cooked. We had both had better steak from my father-in-law and the potatoes were the most amazing part of the meal. I had no problem going in there with the prices but expected the food to be out of this world. It will be a one-time visit for us. It was very busy, so I don't want to say anything about the waitstaff in particular. On a slower night that may have been different."
11/11/2023,ScottK,5.0,"Great Steak! Sides were plenty as well. Wait staff was on the money and the manager on Duty stopped by the table to assure we had everything to our liking and ...He thanked us for our business. This is something not enough business do and I make a habit of it myself so he gets extra-credit!  I had the 20oz bone in Rib Eye and the chef cooked it to my perfect medium-rare. Sides we had were the Corn, mushrooms and Asparagus on the menu! Good time - great food and drink!"
11/11/2023,ScottK,1.0,Our experience was terrible! An important occasion ruined by waiter and then two different managers who clearly did not care that my wife’s birthday dinner was ruined. Will not recommend & word of mouth spreads quickly.
11/11/2023,StacyM,5.0,"Everything was amazing.  The food, the service, the atmosphere everything perfect"
11/11/2023,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"Very loud drinks were made o correctly had the tomahawk and everything was served on top which was like slop
Also Siri g our dinning experience the was a medical situation at the table next to us which made it very uncomfortable"
11/10/2023,Melyssa,5.0,It was fantastic! Everything was cooked to perfection and great value for your money. Highly recommend to everyone who visits Mohegan sun!
11/10/2023,PabR,5.0,This is our second trip and won’t be out last.  Service is too notch from start to end.  Had the porterhouse for 2 and potato trio.
11/07/2023,Greatfood,5.0,We had dinner there last night. The filet’s were excellent and cooked perfectly. The trio of mashed potatoes and asparagus were very good also. They make a great espresso martini. The service was top notch. We would definitely go back!
11/07/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Simone our waitress was extremely attentive and accommodating as my husband has a sodium restriction. She personally worked with the chef and made our dinner experience much less stressful and very much more enjoyable. She had a pleasant demeanor and was very professional and informative.
The food was amazing and the timing of each course and the service itself was impeccable.
We plan on returning as soon as we can!"
11/06/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"My first time enjoying MJ’s Steak House. We had a reservation for 3 people and our table was well sized but still small enough to hear each other. Our Server, Monique, was very polite and knowledgeable. I am allergic to nuts and fish/shellfish but my family is not. Monique was very understanding and helped me know which selections I should stay away from and I felt very comfortable with her help. We each enjoyed different cuts of steaks (Tomahawk, Porterhouse and Filet) , huge baked potatoes and fresh asparagus. The appetizers and meals were nicely plated and Monique surprised my husband with a birthday dessert and candles to end our visit. Overall a really nice experience, I would recommend and look forward to going back."
11/06/2023,robertg,2.0,When we first arrived to celebrate birthday. The water and wine glasses were spotty and needed to be changed. The filet mignon that was ordered by my wife was dry.
11/05/2023,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Very well experience. Half of the party were first timers and we all had great things to say about the food and wine. They can help you pair wine to your order. And birthday surprise was a hit

10/29/2023,BusinessTraveller,5.0,"The steak were fabulous. I had the New York strip, my wife had the filet mignon. As good if not better than any high end steak house we have ever visited. Service was great, drinks were excellent, good pours."

10/29/2023,SusanL,5.0,"The pork chop special was well prepared. Excellent veggies with it. The filet mignon was excellent. Wait staff are friendly, well trained and know the menu. Baked Alaska is well worth ordering."
10/29/2023,Mishredd,4.0,"Overall we had a nice evening. My husband and I ordered steak and I added a side of scallops. The steak was well prepared. The side of scallops was only 3. It was kind of silly for the price. The waitress we had was great. Sadly, we were seated was near the waiters station and in an area where people would continuously walk by, I felt uncomfortable. I had a drink and try to zone it out but for such a nice restaurant, I just hated where we were seated. Honestly, it changed my entire mood and one of the waiters walking by bumped into my chair and made me spill my drink. Should we return, I will ask NOT to be seated in the middle of the restaurant next to the waiters station. Yuk!"
10/28/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We enjoyed the entire experience for our 44 th anniversary!!

The mashed potato trio was a good interesting. If we had to rank them, the classic mashed would be first followed by the spring onion then the bacon gouda."
10/23/2023,JohnP,5.0,Michael Jordan's is just wonderful.  It is always a special evening when we go to MJ's. The service is  wonderful and the food is amazing. Just a great treat to dine there.
10/23/2023,SueK,3.0,Steak was good but not great.  Pasta portion was overwhelmingly large.  Wait for food was longer than I think it should be on a Sunday night.  We will go back but will definitely order something different.
10/22/2023,STEPHANIED,5.0,The food was incredible! I had a Kansas City strip and the loaded baked potato. The restaurant was beautiful. Nice vibe. Too loud in there though.
10/21/2023,DennisM,5.0,"Jordans was outstanding! It always is. Only issue was that it was very busy (good thing, I guess) and it was extremely loud."
10/21/2023,OliviaG,4.0,We had a late dinner reservation and asked if they could accommodate us earlier. They were able to move it up despite it being very crowded. Then our waitress Sarah was lovely.

10/20/2023,StaceyM,5.0,"Get The Garlic Bread Was What Everyone Kept Saying! They Didn't Lie!! It Was Delicious! Tomahawk Surf and Turf was a Sight to See and INCREDIBLE To Eat! Everything We Ordered Was Done to Perfection! Our Waitress Was Friendly and Knowledgeable about the Menu and Made Great Suggestions! Although the Prices are Out Of My ""Every Dinning Out Dinner"" Michael Jordan's Steak House Will Be Our New ""Special Occasion"" Restaurant For Sure!"
10/20/2023,samd,3.0,The ribeye 20 oz. steak was very small for $82 “Texas Roadhouse” ribeye is twice the size $45 . Seems like your sauté spinach comes in frozen then just heated up. Not Good for a reputable steakhouse. Seems the quality is going down rapidly ! The service was great
10/20/2023,VincentM,5.0,Excellent food and service. A little loud but not bad for a crowded restaurant

10/15/2023,Askcherie1,5.0,Amazing. We enjoyed ourselves. We would definitely come again.
10/15/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"A memorable meal. We were seated in a quiet, walled booth as we had asked by a very congenial host who made us feel very welcome. Our server Brian, ably assisted by his understudy Logan, was a pro, never too far away but never in the way. Had all the right advice, and between the two of them, we always had what we needed before we knew we needed it. Food was excellent, my standard salmon was more than complimented by a bed of the most delicious fried rice, with asparagus and snap peas. Wife chose pasta and shrimp with aioli pesto, smelled wonderful but it disappeared before I could snag some. I’d recommend the Manhattan Clam Chowder (sorry New England purists), and the Tomato Arancini was delicious. Have to attempt those at home. Cocktails were generous and well-prepared. Only wish we had room for dessert. Thank you M.J 23 for a special evening. We’ll be back soon."
10/15/2023,JennS,5.0,We always enjoy dinner here! The service is great also!
10/15/2023,SusanS,4.0,"Steak was excellent
Noise level is way louder than I expected, which did damper the evening - hard to talk to people at your table without raising your voice
Service was great as well
Would go again but request to be seated in the back if possible when making reservations"
10/14/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Amazing restaurant.  Very pricey but worth it.  We shared the $129 porterhouse steak which was amazing.   But it came with nothing.  Not even bread.  U have to order and pay more $$ for all the sides.   Nice ambiance. A little noisy but the steaks are amazing!!!!!!!

They were Incredibles attentive, and the manager walked by in a couple of occasions to make sure we were good. Food was amazing. The atmosphere was great and thank you for the birthday card."
10/14/2023,lisah,5.0,"Perfect night to celebrate my daughter and husband's birthdays. We received a complimentary toast and desserts for them. I have passed on coming here in the past because I thought it might be to pricey but it was worth every penny. We got the flight of steaks (filet mignon, prime rib, NY strip and sausage) Beyond perfect as was all the sides and the garlic bread with bleu cheese sauce. Our server was top notch also!"
10/14/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Had a wonderful dinner celebrating birthdays. The food was delicious and the service was great. Will be going back soon.

10/13/2023,diner,5.0,"The garlic bread appetizer with the blue cheese infused dipping sauce was outstanding.  Service was prompt, efficient and friendly.  wine list was good with varied selections.  Carrot cake was a good choice for dessert"
10/13/2023,Julia,5.0,It was my husband’s and my first dining experience there. I put in the reservation we were celebrating our anniversary and the staff the whole night came up to us to say congratulations and gave us a card and champagne. The staff was attentive and the food was great. I highly recommend going if you have never been!
10/12/2023,Mitch,4.0,"Food and service were both outstanding. 
Unfortunately we had to wait about 20 min for our table even though we had a reservation. The staff did apologize multiple times.
But we did end up having an excellent table. 
The restaurant was full which I wish I would have known when making the reservation 
The server (Janine) was out standing allowing to have a slower paced meal and fully explained everything."
10/11/2023,JessicaS,5.0,18 years ago my husband and I traveled to Mohegan Sun for our anniversary. We came back for the first time together since then and chose Michael Jordan’s Steakhouse for our dinner. We were greeted by friendly staff who presented us with a card signed by all. Or dinner was delicious and our server was very attentive and polite. She presented us with a “gift” with our check of a brownie dessert. She stated they normally do champagne but I had ordered a Mock-tail so she knew I didn’t drink. We really enjoyed our dinner and will be back again a lot sooner than before!
10/11/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"First time here and everything was fantastic! We had the seafood plate - everything was fresh and the quality was great. The steaks were done to perfection. And the side of mashed potatoes trio were the perfect accompaniment.

And super friendly waitstaff!"

10/09/2023,PatM,5.0,Michael Jordan’s restaurant was wonderful. Our server was terrific and very knowledgeable. I felt they could have had more choices for side orders. Not much to choose from for my taste.
10/09/2023,GarryL,5.0,Another excellent meal - cooked perfectly - service was outstanding !
10/08/2023,ErikD,4.0,Food and service were excellent!  Celebrated our anniversary.  Complementary champagne toast was really nice!  The only thing that made it slightly less enjoyable was our table.  Table for 2 up against a wall.  We had to lean against the wall when people were passing by our table.
10/08/2023,ctha,5.0,First time eating at MJs steakhouse house and it was really good. Our steak was cooked perfectly the way we wanted delicious will be going back again.
10/07/2023,NickC,4.0,"Our server was great and friendly. The garlic bread app was very good. My steak was overcooked and not very tasty, as well as the mashed potato side. Our server was nice and comp’d my steak, so that was appreciated. Overall, a nice experience but I’ve had better steak at other restaurants."
10/07/2023,fredS,5.0,"Great food and excellent service. We had a reservation booked and only had to wait a few minutes until seated. We were able to take our time ordering with no feelings of being rushed ordering drinks, apps dinner and dessert."

10/06/2023,LenL,5.0,Classic steakhouse with high-quality food and excellent service.
10/04/2023,Rich,5.0,The server was excellent I didn't get her name. We went there for my birthday and they surprised me with a birthday card that was signed and a ice cream cake with a candle in it. The whole place is top notch.
10/04/2023,BillR,4.0,"Let me first start by saying how great my server Kate was.   Very friendly and knowledgeable.  Food was fantastic.  If there was one thing I feel could have been done much better was the Baked Alaska.  Not much flavor, but other than that a fantastic meal."
10/04/2023,PamelaF,5.0,Michael Jordan’s is our special go to treat for important occasions. We are treated with care and the food is outstanding. I can’t wait for our next dinner there. So so good💕
10/03/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Fabulous high end meal.  Attention to detail.  Food and service stellar.  Get the bacon appetizer and the street corn and the trio of mashed potato.  Steaks are cooked with perfect char.   Don’t miss this one.  Usually go to Tao first night.  Now we will switch it up and go here first
10/03/2023,DawnW,3.0,"Service was excellent, ambience was good but food was disappointing for the price that we paid."
10/01/2023,NellyR,5.0,Spectacular! Food and service was excellent!!! Definitely worth it
10/01/2023,SarahF,5.0,Sofia was fabulous. The service and food were exemplary. It was the perfect birthday surprise dinner for my boyfriend. We will be returning.

09/30/2023,JosephF,5.0,Excellent food and service but it is pricey. Glass of house wine $19
09/30/2023,Partyof3,5.0,"Amazing food and service! Highly recommended, excellent service too!"
09/30/2023,MelissaE,4.0,"We had to wait about 10-15 mins upon arrival despite having a reservation. There were high top tables available but they were in a noisy and crowded part of the restaurant. The table we were given was somewhat in the middle still in a loud area. We were surprised not to be given the private booth seating since it appeared there were available tables in the back but they were trying to fill the tables in the middle. Very noisy so if you're looking to have a quiet conversation with friends or a significant other, this isn't the place to go. The servers were all very friendly and quick to take orders and refill water glasses. The food also came out rather quickly which was nice. The filet mignon was very good and side dishes are even better. I'd recommend the Mac and cheese and mashed potato trio as a side. Expensive meal but that's to be expected for this type of rearaurant."
09/29/2023,MarisaC,5.0,"Michael Jordan's Steakhouse is our go to for any celebration. The drinks and the food are always delicious. The service is outstanding. The server Ryan, who we have had a few times, genuinely enjoys what he does and it shows."
09/28/2023,SueM,5.0,"Our server and his coworkers were awesome!! We were going to the concert after our dinner and they were willing to wrap up a piece of meat for me to put in a small bag, so appreciate it.  We had it for breakfast the next day!"
09/27/2023,ARTHURS,4.0,"We have been coming here for years, our most favorite steakhouse, period, end. The quality of the meat and the attention given to its preparation has always been excellent. This was, however, the first time our medium rare NY Strip was more medium than we prefer. Not enough to send it back but not up to its usual perfection, where every bit of the meat, with the exception of the very ends, has been perfectly medium rare. This time at least half the steak was medium, not close to rare. We are measuring against MJ’s past performance, not against our own perception of medium rare. It is has been consistant for years, this time it was not. We will of course be back, it’s still the best steak restaurant going (much better than Jerry West’s 44 🤣 a playoff of sorts for us!) and we won’t let one off night deter our opinion. We will be more vocal about it when ordering the next time.❤️"
09/25/2023,huge,4.0,"Been here numerous times was the best Delmonico steak I’ve had yet, and the wagyu steak was also excellent ￼"
09/25/2023,DavidS,5.0,Delicious steak and salmon along with the trio of potatoes. Very good service.
09/24/2023,PhoebeC,5.0,"Our dinner was delicious. Chris was our server and never missed a beat. We celebrated a birthday and we received a card and complimentary dessert. It was a relaxing, quiet environment."
09/24/2023,FrankS,5.0,Food is always outstanding and waitresses are also very professional.
09/24/2023,ShawnS,5.0,"Celebrating a birthday at Jordan’s was fantastic. The service was great, Kamee was an awesome server. Food and Drinks were tops, from Seafood Tower to Steaks, Corn and peppers to Bread and potatoes all were cooked to perfection. Highly recommend MJ’s."
09/23/2023,HomerR,4.0,"While waiting at bar for our table, service seemed uncoordinated. Took 10 minutes for bar personnel to take our order, despite a couple of seemingly idle staffers. Right after that, three additional bar people came within minutes to take our order! Once seated in dining room, service was excellent, as was the food. Started out with a beef bruschetta appetizer, which was delightful. Ryan delivered our meals from the kitchen, explaining each one. He was obviously - and rightfully - proud of these meals. We both had the 10-ounce filet, both cooked perfectly to medium as ordered. One with a half lobster, and one with seared scallops. Sides were mashed potatoes and asparagus, which were excellent. Atmosphere is much louder than I expected in a restaurant of this caliber. Besides being very dark, the noise level is about as boisterous as a Texas Roadhouse restaurant. Also, I understood the dress code to be ""business casual,"" but it did not seem to be enforced. Would recommend overall."
09/23/2023,DarleneG,5.0,"Very nice dinner celebrating 30th wedding anniversary. Food, ambiance and service were great!"
09/23/2023,RamonB,5.0,The food was great. The service was great but I was disappointed on the dress code. I saw people wearing workout shorts yet your when setting up reservations online it specified a dress code.
09/22/2023,Lance,5.0,First time here and loved it.  Will be back soon!!
09/22/2023,Heather,4.0,We enjoyed a special birthday dinner. Delicious food and outstanding service. Dining room was a bit too noisy. Overall a very nice evening.
09/22/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellent service good food and drinks.  Would recommend
09/21/2023,SCOTTM,5.0,Always a great meal. The delmonico is out of this world
09/19/2023,JimD,5.0,"Our server Michael and his helper, Logan, were absolutely terrific. They were both very pleasant throughout the evening. The food, as always , was delicious."
09/19/2023,ChristinaC,4.0,"Michael Jordan’s always has the best Filet Mignon! Their garlic bread is to die for, and I’m not even a fan of blue cheese. It is on the pricey side though."
09/19/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellence in every aspect!! We went for our 1st wedding anniversary and we were treated so beautifully by our waitress. She offered us complimentary treats & we were left with an anniversary card on the table that the staff signed! Even the busser was pleasant! Dinner was excellent from the start to finish! More food than we could have expected! Just pure perfection!
09/18/2023,Ashlee,5.0,"I took my boyfriend there to celebrate his birthday since he is a foodie and a huge Michael Jordan fan. Not only were the food and drinks incredible (he loved everything he ate and swears the Midas Touch cocktail was the best drink), but the waitstaff were amazing. Our waitress, Sarah, was the best and made sure we were taken care of. She even surprised him with a birthday dessert. We left there happy and we can’t wait to go back again!"
09/18/2023,Dell,2.0,"For the cost of the meal the quality was extremely lacking. In comparison to other steak houses at this level such as J Gilbert’s or Ruth Chris this is in no comparison and the meal was extremely disappointing. The salad that we started with was the best part of meal the lemon vinaigrette was great . Additionally, our waitress was very nice nothing against her at all just the steak was lacking."
09/17/2023,MImi,3.0,The food is mediocre at best. Because of the quality the price seems unreasonably high. The steak was dry and a little tough ( I had it medium rare.  The parmesan truffle fries were delicious. I usually love creamed spinach but this was horrible. We could not believe the bread crumbs on this dish- completely overwhelmed the spinach.  Best was the shrimp cocktail appetizer - they were delicious and cooked perfectly. The cocktail sauce was too sweet and needed a little kick.  The server Nikki was pleasant and knowledgeable and adequate. She was busy and took a long time.
09/17/2023,jeffa,5.0,Amazing amazing amazing. Our Anniversary couldn’t have been any better. We have come back time any time again. Never disappointed!
09/17/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We had such a great evening! Chris was a wonderful server. Good and service were impeccable. Comfortable seating. Complimentary choc layer cake with candles. What a fun birthday celebration!
09/17/2023,JoyB,5.0,"FANTASTIC!! From the minute we walked in we were blown away with the friendly welcoming staff, to our awesome waitress Jeanine to the delicious food.  Our waitress Jeanine was very attentive, friendly and never missed a beat. Our appetizers, entrees and desserts were above and beyond delicious! We will definitely be back soon."
09/16/2023,JAMESH,5.0,"Outstanding service and food.  Robert, our waiter has a complete understanding of attention to details and it was a pleasure to dine at MJ’s for our Anniversary as we do annually"
09/16/2023,Francesca,2.0,"We waited a good 15 minutes when we had a reservation, and then waited another 15 minutes to get waited on.  I ordered the Rib Eye Bone In - $82.00.  It was terrible, like leather, very chewy, I sent it back.  I ended up ordering the small Filet Mignon, which was not cooked Medium as I had ordered it for the Rib Eye, it was Medium Rare, but at that point I just wanted to leave as we had already been sitting there for 1 1/2 hours.  
The manager did come over and apologize, said he would take the rib eye off the bill (well I hope so, seeing as I sent it back!) but, they did charge me for the filet....not sure about that one.  Then we get our bill and they charged us $40 for ONE Crab Cake, which was tasteless and maybe the size of a Hockey Puck. It said Market Price on the menu, probably wanted to make up for the loss on the Rib Eye so over charged us for that sad, sad crab cake. Terrible!  We will never go there again."
09/16/2023,JohnE,3.0,My 79.00 Prime Delmonico steak lacked flavor and was full of gristle throughout. I have had better steaks at Texas Roadhouse for 3xs less money
09/16/2023,Travis,5.0,We had a great time ! Denise our waiter did a fantastic job!  The entire staff was professional we had a great experience
09/15/2023,kirstinz,5.0,"amazing as always. The food is unbelievable, and the service is impeccable."
09/15/2023,KarenC,4.0,"Excellent meal...I only wish they had seated us more in the back, we were out celebrating our anniversary and we were in the front ...it was too bright and too noisy"
09/15/2023,MARKUS,4.0,Enjoyed our dinner. Appetizers (Caesar salad & clam chowder) were on the small side even though they said we could share. Steaks were amazing. Had the 10oz filet & 18oz NY strip. Both were cooked perfect & flavorful. Service was great. $240 total.
09/15/2023,JessicaLee,5.0,Dinner date before a show. 1st time here and wow it was fabulous! Kate was our sever and she was top notch! Very knowledgeable with the menu! Able to answer questions and offer suggestions. The food was mouth watering amazing! Good service is most important to us and the staff was 5 stars! Kate is an asset to the restaurant and we Will highly recommend to friends and family
09/14/2023,Josh,5.0,Absolutely phenomenal service by all and the best porterhouse steak I’ve ever eaten! Highly recommend!
09/14/2023,SallyW,5.0,"Server Ryan was a joy as always. Good amazing, with great cocktails"
09/14/2023,KateS,4.0,Food was good but the table next to us had two toddlers that were hollering and crying. It was hard to hear and quite distracting. I have no issues with kids in restaurants but when I'm paying $80 for a steak I don't want to have to shout to be heard.
09/14/2023,LoriW,1.0,"Very disappointed. Service from the front staff to server was sub par. I can look past that…maybe they’re short staff, but the food that we received was horrible. Porterhouse for 2, very expensive for poor quality beef, could barely chew the strip side. Asparagus very smoky, no lemon taste. Be warned, restaurant extremely loud as well."
09/14/2023,CarlaP,5.0,Best restaurant around! Dallas and his staff are amazing!
09/14/2023,kathyB,4.0,"The steak and salmon were excellent, but the accompaniments were salty.  My husband is a salt lover and for him to say too much was a statement.  We couldn’t speak due to the noise level.  The service was excellent.  Overall it was a good experience."
09/14/2023,ChristinaM,5.0,"Great service and atmosphere. Fun spot before a concert. The band was eating there, too!"
09/14/2023,BarbaraL,5.0,Great service and great food. Always a delicious meal.
09/13/2023,PatriciaJ,5.0,"We had Manhattan Clam Crowder  porterhouse for two, potatoes and corn. It was outstanding.  Very pleased."
09/13/2023,roberts,5.0,"Our waiters Chris and Taylor made an already phenomenal experience even more enhanced...both of these gentlemen were attentive and amazing... we had a 945pm reservation.... we were the last diners to be in the restaurant...Chris and Taylor never made us feel rushed...even though we were the last patrons there...

My only negative....after we had dessert...paid the bill...bagged the leftovers to go....a man, who I had not seen before...came to our table and said... well folks it's time to go...  that was unnecessary...we were leaving and knew that it was time to leave... I'm assuming he was a manager or whatever... but him saying and doing that...was the one tarnish on an otherwise perfect night

If you dine at MJ ...ask for Chris and Taylor... great duo

And to the manager or whoever said that... thanks for being the one negative in this review... if you have a problem with late diners...then don't offer late reservations"
09/12/2023,CarolM,5.0,"5 star all around.
Our server Tusa was so pleasant & very accommodating.
The food was high quality.
Everyone made our 52nd anniversary celebration very special.
Thank you."
09/12/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Great overall dining experience! Worth every penny—from the service, to the ambience and menu selection. The steak flight was amazing as well as drink selection."
09/10/2023,PatriciaB,5.0,We had a great meal and our server Hillary was tremendous !
09/10/2023,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Great experience overall went here with my fiancee for our anniversary. The food was delicious. the service was great. The only thing they could have done better was make the night a little more special for us as I requested on the reservation. I hinted at some things that i wished they executed on to make the evening overall better, but I was still pleased with the experience ."
09/09/2023,PDUB,5.0,"Although I felt a little packed in (like cattle) our server made our experience feel more comfortable with her pleasant demeanor and perfect recommendations. 
 She kept us focused on the “food experience” rather than the crowd."
09/09/2023,Ciccone,4.0,"Service was fantastic! Steaks were awesome and cooked perfect! Got the half lobster, not impressed. Very small and meat was very chewy. I expected for $42 that it would be tender.
Crab cake app was superb. All crab no fillers!"
09/08/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"It’s always fantastic and last night was no exception. We sat at the bar and Brad waited on us. We are regulars so we usually get the same thing: Rib eye, loaded baked potato, a half order of creamed spinach. My husband arrived before me as I was attending to our hotel bell service delivery.  He ordered a half order of garlic bread. He loves that app. I stay away from bread since it fills me up. The meal we get is perfect for a couple to split. The service is great and the bartenders all know how to make a good drink. They have fantastic old fashioneds. Thank you!"
09/08/2023,MalikB,5.0,"Great service from everyone, great appetizers (garlic bread and crab cake) great sides (mashed potato trio, street corn & creamed spinach) and the filets were amazing! Look forward to coming back again soon!"
09/07/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The Chilean sea bass was cooked to perfection. I highly recommend it for non red-meat eaters or those who prefer a lighter dish.  The gentleman who brought out our dishes was extremely friendly and sweet. Made the whole experience that much better.  Can get a bit noisy but that is expected with the casino vibe.  Great dinner choice while staying at  Mohegan Sun.
09/05/2023,DaveS,5.0,"Everything about the restaurant was fantastic , our waitress was at the top of her game. Food was great and cooked correctly. Never rushed which I like."

09/03/2023,AleksanderK,5.0,Amazing food service etc it’s a bit pricey but worth what you’re getting for sure
09/03/2023,EatLovePray,4.0,"MJ Steakhouse was a pleasant surprise to put weekend. We will be returning soon. I would recommend the steak flights they offer to try a variety from the menu.

09/02/2023,Bruce,2.0,No cheeseburger - upscale expensive steak house. Manager was rude
09/02/2023,EviC,5.0,"Food and service was amazing! I loved the crab cakes, salmon, and steak frites. Jen was so great to us and helped make my birthday special"
09/02/2023,BasiaB,5.0,Our server Chris was fabulous! He did an outstanding job! It was our first time there together and I could not be any more pleased. The food was delicious and every recommendation Chris made was spot on! We even made a point to talk to the general manager to let him know how pleased we were. We highly recommend this Resturant.
09/02/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Amazing service and amazing food!! Love it every time.
09/02/2023,AlisonW,5.0,"We took my daughter and her husband there for their first wedding anniversary. Everything was great, food was outstanding and the wait staff was absolutely fantastic."
09/02/2023,marionc,5.0,"Just excellent. Absolutely EVERY time we've dined at Michael Jordan's the food is delicious, the staff is so personable and attentive and we couldn't ask for a better experience. Don't miss the crab cake, the garlic bread and of course...the steaks!"
09/02/2023,AislynnA,5.0,Very expensive so we only go here once or twice a year but worth every penny
09/01/2023,TaylorS,5.0,Nothing was bad. The garlic bread was good good. Steak was cooked perfectly. Portions were good. We cannot wait to go back.
09/01/2023,christinec,5.0,Wonderful birthday dinner. Food wine and service excellent

09/01/2023,TAMMYE,5.0,Great meal. Cooked perfectly. Service was excellent. Noise level was very loud. Very expensive meal but nice for a special occasion.
09/01/2023,TrishR,3.0,"The food was sub-par, didn’t get the quality I was expecting for the $$, rice was too salty.
My partner enjoyed the filet mignon but mashed potatoes were sticky."
08/29/2023,DaveW,5.0,"Still has the best filet mignon I’ve ever had. Great ambiance, and the staff is too notch."
08/29/2023,Islander,5.0,"Our server Jenine was wonderful.  The beverages were icy cold, the garlic bread certainly did not disappoint, and the entrees and sides were delicious."
08/27/2023,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Dinner was very nice, and the food was really great. Our waitress was extremely nice. Her timing was extremely off and she never came back on time with anything.    We asked for dessert menus, but she never came back to order the dessert and that’s just one example.

I was a little disappointed in that, but overall I would definitely eat there again"
08/27/2023,LeeD,4.0,"All in all the restaurant and meals were  4 stars.  There was however, one incident which surprised me. Our waiter asked if we would like to start off with the garlic bread and we agreed and since it was a “bread” assumed it was complimentary.  It was very good but what he did not mention when he suggested it that it was not a complimentary bread and there was a $13 charge for it!   We probably would have ordered it anyway but being informed ahead of time would have been more professional."
08/27/2023,Anniversary,5.0,"Once again MJ’S pulled out all the stops.  We were there for our 53rd Anniversary. As usual the staff made us feel special.  

Thank you for making us feel so special."

08/27/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,It was wonderful! Waiter was exceptional! Highly recommend.
08/26/2023,RBF1,5.0,"The staff at Michael Jordan has certainly improved. It was always good, but yesterday every single one was excellent. Very professional and friendly. Food was delicious and came out piping hot and pretty quickly. We had a birthday gift card and when the staff saw it, they surprised us with a little birthday dessert which was incredibly sweet(no pun intended) and delicious. I love when staff goes the extra mile. There is nothing that compares to excellent customer service in this day and age. Prices are comparable to other restaurants of this type. Sides are ala cart. Hint: Mashed potato trio a must!! My husband had a filet cooked perfectly and I had the spare rib pasta. Both were delicious. I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. 
There is always one person or a table of people who are the loud ones, but it quickly became apparent to them that this isn’t the place for that and they got very quiet pretty quickly. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience and will be back for sure."
08/26/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Staff was attentive and friendly, very helpful and understanding of my many food allergies. Great food!"
08/25/2023,RayDC,4.0,"Great waitstaff, it was my wife’s birthday and the card she got was very much appreciated. We also were served a free dessert that hit the spot. First time there and it won’t be the last. Waitstaff was wonderful."

08/24/2023,GlennE,5.0,"Michael Jordan’s Steakhouse at Mohegan Sun offers an exceptional dining experience that transcends expectations. From the moment you enter, the ambiance exudes sophistication, complemented by impeccable service. The menu showcases a culinary mastery that parallels Jordan’s dominance in basketball. Each steak is a masterpiece, perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor. The attention to detail is evident in every dish, from the appetizers to the desserts. The wine selection is extensive, enhancing the overall indulgence. Whether you’re a sports enthusiast or a food connoisseur, Michael Jordan’s Steakhouse delivers a slam dunk in both taste and atmosphere."
08/23/2023,JodyC,5.0,Simply amazing never had a better steak. Amazing wine Selection
08/23/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Went for a birthday dinner and it was amazing. The staff is very welcoming. Multiple staff members came and wished a Happy Birthday. Our servers was ATTENTIVE! The food was GREAT! I now have a special thing for the Wagyu Meatballs & Garlic Bread w/ Blue Cheese Fondue *MUST TRY*! Will definitely be back again!
08/23/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Everything was outstanding.Best crab cake we ever had.  Our server Chris was the best.
08/22/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We went to Michael Jordan’s for our 31st wedding anniversary and what a truly lovely experience we had. They treated us like royalty and the food was amazing!!! We highly recommend this place and I cannot wait to come back
08/21/2023,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"My husband and I sat at the bar, we were greeted by three FABULOUS bartenders. They were a pleasure and knew their stuff, the Poundcake martini was delicious. We ordered shrimp cocktail for an app and it was good. For our entree we ordered the Porterhouse for two and the Trio of mashed potatoes. The potatoes were delicious, steak was inedible. It was over cooked and tasted so salty I could barely stomach it, it was 110$!! We did eat some of the filet and did not complain because the service was so great. This restaurant is a steak house obviously and we were extremely disappointed in the main event!"
08/21/2023,DavidD,5.0,Our meal was the best I’ve had in sometime my watriss was fantastic and the wine was great
08/20/2023,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Food was good not too crazy about the pasta with. Meat thought it was a different pasta .?
08/20/2023,MaryM,5.0,"When I made the reservation, it asked if the visit is for a special occasion. It was our 40th wedding anniversary. When we arrived at MJSH, they gave us a cozy booth, two glasses of champagne, and a complimentary appetizer. What a great unexpected surprise! The Porterhouse for two was fabulous, and the side so delicious. We got the Japanese street corn and the mushrooms. I recommend having the blood orange sorbet even if you are stuffed from your meal. It was just the right end to our meal...light and refreshing. I cannot wait to come back! TY MJSH!"
08/20/2023,RebeccaL,5.0,Absolutely perfect. From the service to food and atmosphere. Restaurant is super clean. Will return
08/19/2023,CharlesK,5.0,"I’m a little biased, because this has to be my favorite restaurant. Great food, Great service, Great value. If you get the chance don’t hesitate just go 😉😉😉"
08/19/2023,AlbertD,3.0,steak was tough with no flavor .was cook perfect medium rare .never had a kc strip so bad. Mastro restaurant is so much better .
08/19/2023,Tedd,5.0,The food and service were exceptional. Never felt rushed or waiting on anything from start to finish. A bit pricey but worth it.
08/18/2023,RobertS,5.0,Service was outstanding. They catered to our dietary needs
08/18/2023,JohnD,5.0,Our waitress Sarah was just as amazing as the food. Worth every penny.  We will definitely be back ! The restaurant manager and Sarah even surprised my son and I with the best tasting Baked Alaska we have ever had.  Thank you to them and the entire staff. Delicious food with outstanding service.
08/18/2023,Jeff,5.0,"Our dinner at MJ's the week before was so impressive, we couldn't return fast enough for another visit. Once again, the entire experience was flawless. We requested Chris repeat as our server and he, and the rest of his tem, were OUTSTANDING - steaks and sides were cooked to perfection and every course was paced properly. This level of quality is no accident. The manager (Barry) was circulating through the dining area all night, introducing himself at each table, making sure all patrons felt welcome, valued and were receiving 5-star food quality and attention. I have been to all the top-rated steakhouses in NYC and imho you won't get better food, service or ambience than you'll find at this MJ's."
08/18/2023,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"Our steaks were literally horrible - not edible & outrageously expensive for an awful meal.
Definitely do not recommend"
08/17/2023,StephenM,5.0,Amanda and Tyler were awesome!   Food was delicious.  Definitely recommend the short rib pasta and the 10oz filet mignon with Japanese street corn
08/17/2023,DennisK,5.0,"Jennifer was our waitress.  She was excellent!  There were others who added to the excellence of our dining experience as well.   Most notably, the gentleman who interacted with us at our table just to see how everything was,  truly impressed us.  It’s so nice to see that the staff at Michael Jordan’s is so hospitable.  We will definitely be back!"
08/16/2023,christinaw,5.0,Amazing birthday dinner. The food was phenomenal and our server was happy and energetic which added to the experience.  Expensive but worth every penny.
08/16/2023,Shirl,5.0,"Had a delicious dinner for my girlfriends birthday. The staff signed a card for her and brought out a bday dessert. First time there, but will definitely be going back! Also GET THE GARLIC BREAD!"
08/16/2023,JudyO,5.0,"We had a lovely time. It was my birthday and I was greeted with happy birthday, given a B’Day card, and a lighted candle was atop our dessert. Our waitress was outstanding and the food was excellent. We eat at MJ’s every time we visit Mohegan Sun."
08/16/2023,DavidB,5.0,"Such a wonderful culinary experience. Great ambience, service and atmosphere."
08/16/2023,IvanG,5.0,"Our server, Adrianne, was fantastic, very friendly.  We were greeted by a card signed by the staff, as we were celebrating our anniversary.

08/16/2023,CarissaF,5.0,Food was delicious.  Highly recommend this restaurant
08/15/2023,MarkK,5.0,Great food and service!  If you are staying at the casino this restaurant needs to be on your list.  5 Stars
08/14/2023,SusanO,5.0,Celebrating our anniversary in style. Great food drinks and attentive service
08/13/2023,LuisP,5.0,Food was amazing. Service was incredible. Spent a mint so it's not a cheap date spot. Loud noise levels because it's in a casino and it was packed. Reservations only last night.  Very annoying almost elevator music on loop. But good drinks and overall 9/10
08/12/2023,CarolP,5.0,"First time back in years, but it was absolutely delicious"
08/12/2023,Needarevrwwe,5.0,"Phenomenal food. We usually eat at home as we are above average cooks and prefer the quality and value of home cooking. However, every single item at MJ Steakhouse blew us out of the water. Out of this world taste, quality, presentation, and enjoyment. We’re spoiled now! Can’t wait to come back."
08/12/2023,Rich,5.0,They always make you feel so special. It's the customers night for sure. The customer is defiantly the celebrity. They make everyone feel so important. Defiantly the customers night. It's my go to place when at Mohegan Sun
08/11/2023,Jeff,5.0,"I wanted my sister's 75th birthday to be memorable and our dinner at MJs couldn't have been a better choice or more superb! Garlic bread and crab cakes are must-have appetizers if you haven't experienced them before. Filets and Tomahawk ribeye Oscar were cooked to a perfect medium rare - tender, juicy and flavorful. Creamed spinach, mashed potato trio and sauteed mushrooms were the perfect complements. The 23 layer chocolate cake was an exquisite finish. And if I failed to mention how much Chris and Ryan added to the enjoyment of our experience, I would be criminally remiss. They, and the rest of the wait staff made us feel as if we were their only table for the evening. Kudos to them and management for ensuring all their patrons leave with memories of an extraordinary dining experience!"
08/11/2023,Imps,5.0,The food was fantastic. Had the best waitress ever. Her name was Nicky. Explained everything fully. Had great personality.
08/09/2023,TonyB,5.0,"Good food. Even better service. I was explicitly happy with the service. Adrian   our female server was outstanding. Attention to detail, follow-up and hospitality was amazing. Manager table touch. Only disappointment was not receiving the bone, on cut up ribeye steak."
08/08/2023,MaryannB,5.0,Fantastic! We both had steak - filet mignon for me and Porterhouse for my boyfriend- sauteed spinach and mashed potatoes. Portions were really good - go there very hungry. Quality was superb
08/06/2023,JL06,4.0,MJ's is good but this was our third visit and the level of service and quality of the food wasn't quite what we had in previous times unfortunately.
08/06/2023,DanHas,4.0,The three kinds of mashed potatoes were very good the mushrooms were awesome the garlic bread was awesome the Manhattan clam chowder was awesome but the porterhouse steak was pretty good...a little grisly and tough. We have been happier on past visits.
08/05/2023,HeidiW,5.0,"Front desk kept us updated while waiting to be seated. We received a signed card from the entire staff wishing us a happy anniversary
Our server Joanne was perfect
The food is AMAZING
On the pricey side but was a great celebration"
08/05/2023,MelissaE,5.0,"I love the relaxed feel of this place - make it the way you want it: formal or informal. I definitely would return to try more dishes. The Friday surf N turf special was amazing! The on the house glasses of champagne to commemorate the celebratory night was a nice touch. My husband and I enjoyed everything that was ordered and brought to the table. Service was well-timed and friendly, wines were affordable."
08/05/2023,Sourpatch,3.0,Outstanding service. Food was very underwhelming.
08/04/2023,DeniseR,1.0,"The food was flavorless!!! Spending $250 for two people you expect quality food.  Corn side dish inedible- I got the filet and you obviously could see someone cut the filet in half- The Japanese street corn was inedible- flavor combinations were so wrong- What a complete let down- expected way more for a fine dining establishment. 
Hi expectations- Absolutely Disappointed"
08/04/2023,LoriP,5.0,The food never disappoints me.  Always delicious!!
08/03/2023,RachelD,3.0,"I was expecting this to be a superb meal, but it was just ok."
08/02/2023,Bella,3.0,"The steak is delicious but 10 oz  filet mignon is on the rather small size. Certain side dishes like the wedge salad, creamed spinach and mashed potatoes should be a lot better than what was served. They were just okay. For a high end steak house like this place,  they all should be mouthwatering."
08/01/2023,TomD,5.0,The service and dinner were excellent! Barry Fortin manager was excellent!
08/01/2023,GeorgeC,4.0,"Always a great experience.  Good, service and ambiance top shelf.  Definitely gets my endorsement!"

07/31/2023,KelliannW,5.0,The staff was very attentive with us the whole time. Food was excellent  and cooked to medium rare like we requested .We would return in the future.
07/30/2023,AdrianV,5.0,"Lovely dinner at Michael Jordan's.  The staff was top-notch and very professional.  Steak, of course, was beautiful.  Others at our party had crab cakes and special sirloin with scallops.  We finished the evening with a lovely dessert - I had baked Alaska - so good and refreshing.  This is our go-to place when we are in the area.  As an aside, this is located within a casino, but entering from the hotel is easy - go in the hotel entrance and keep to your left.   Valet parking is available and free.  There is abundant shopping and waterfalls.  A genuinely splendid experience, far and above any other casino.  Beautiful grounds and experience."
07/30/2023,DonnaM,5.0,"The waitress was delightful and made us feel welcome and comfortable. The food was excellent - and the vegetables had unusual but scrumptious sauces. It is very pricy, but the steak was probably the best I have ever eaten."
07/30/2023,PegD,5.0,Our dinner was outstanding and the service was great.  I would highly recommend.
07/29/2023,MatthewO,5.0,Excellent food and outstanding wait staff and front of house
07/29/2023,marionc,5.0,"ALWAYS delicious. Michael Jordan's Steak House is our all-time favorite and we always dine there when we visit Mohegan Sun. The food is outstanding and the service is superb. We are always warmly greeted and the serving staff is knowledgeable, are friendly and seem to truly care. Even the folks that deliver the food from the kitchen are incredibly friendly. Managers and assistant managers come to check on us and we're especially fond of manager Dallas who makes us feel special. This visit we really enjoyed the oysters, wedge salad, scallops, pasta, filet mignon and of course we always have the garlic bread. Love, love, love it!"
07/29/2023,PeckO,5.0,Excellent food and service. Highly recommend. I felt it was a little to dark in dining room but that was not really a big issue at all
07/28/2023,Mimmo,5.0,"The five of us shared the MVP board which was a great representation of 5 select cuts from the menu, with salads, apps, and 23 layer chocolate cake we left winners!  Even a couple of early fouls on our servers part were overcome by sheer will of happiness!  Always a great meal at MJ23!"
07/28/2023,DEBRAPJ,5.0,"Great place to eat 
From the hostess desk to the wait staff everyone is always excellent"

07/26/2023,DebT,5.0,"It was our first time dining at Michael Jordan's for our anniversary.  We received a card signed by the staff and 2 complimentary glasses of champagne, what a wonderful way to start the evening!  Melissa was our server and she was top notch, very knowledgeable of the menu and drinks and made great recommendations.  The food was outstanding, it's expensive, but well worth it if you're looking for a nice evening out.  We even met Dallas, the manager who stopped by to ask if everything was to our liking.... it certainly was and we will be back.  Don't skip the Baked Alaska!"
07/26/2023,Melmom,5.0,"Great Great food!!!!
I would go back again and again!!

07/24/2023,JoshNY,2.0,"Steaks were subpar for a restaurant at this level. Overcooked and dry. Sides and desserts, drinks and service were better."
07/24/2023,SeanE,4.0,"My complaint is the table for two we were sat at was too small. That has never been an issue before. I will request a larger table next time. I feel the prices are too high for the serving size. Larger portions please.
My compliment is that the food is very good, and prepared how I ordered it. The service was great and always has been. I always look forward to dinner at MJ’s and will continue to make reservations when I come to Moheagan Sun. Also I want to say the bar staff are great, friendly and attentive."
07/23/2023,Jess2,5.0,"Always amazing from the front staff to the back!  Extremely accommodating and pleasant, Simone our server is THE BEST!  Portions were shareable and every dish we had was on point."
07/22/2023,LaurenT,5.0,The food was absolutely amazing and the service was amazing. Only food complaint was the asparagus was incredibly lemony which is odd paired with steak and potatoes. Also it was so loud in the restaurant we could barely hear each other talk at the table. Just not what I was expecting for a fine dining experience noise wise.
07/22/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Phenomenal food and service
We loved it can’t wait to go back"
07/21/2023,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Great experience! Service and ambience excellent. The only reason I rated a four is because a few items were better on our prior visits. For example, the mushrooms had this sauce on it that wasn’t on their before and there was variety of mushrooms this time that didn’t happen. Seafood gratin not great cheese sauce. But everything else was excellent."
07/21/2023,AlexS,5.0,Our waitress was phenomenal and so knowledgeable with assisting with our wine pairings.The garlic bread with blue cheese fondue still has me drooling 22 hours later! We will definitely be back!
07/20/2023,redrose5200,4.0,Food was very good and Allison was a great waitress.
07/20/2023,RobinG,4.0,Operated and overpriced. The waitstaff is the best selling point.  Everyone was extraordinary!

07/17/2023,LarryS,5.0,"Great food and always consistent , server was incredible."
07/17/2023,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Some tables are almost in the dark. Diners of all ages using phone flashlights to see the menu. Food was good but if I never ate there again I’d be fine. Serving staff top notch, nice , accommodating when we asked to move to a better lit less noisy table."
07/17/2023,DianaO,1.0,service was awful !!  asked for extra well done meat and it was medium - asked the waitress to have it cooked extra well done - she never asked if we needed another drink or how the food was - terrible service
07/16/2023,VincentR,3.0,Food was good. I was expecting better service than what we had.
07/16/2023,Maureen,5.0,Had a great birthday dinner for my lover!  Service is always awesome and food always soooo delicious!  Manager Dallas is always making sure things are in tip top shape!  Thank you MJ!
07/16/2023,Majorcook,5.0,"If you’re looking for a GREAT dinner, here’s your spot! We expected great service and great food and we’re not disappointed. The green salad was even awesome. Be sure to save a little room for the crème brûlée. Yum."
07/16/2023,RichS,5.0,Such a good meal! The filet was perfect. Loved the trio mashed potatoes. Street corn was great. Very good service and wine selection.
07/16/2023,DLMA,3.0,I ordered the Miso Salmon. The salmon was cooked as requested but the seasoning of both salmon and bed of rice were quite heavily salted which diluted any flavor of the fish.  The baked macaroni was milky and there was no cheesiness as a result of the liquidity of sauce.  An order which included firs were seasoned quite abundantly with salt. Lamb chops were cooked to order but not satisfying. Servers were very polite.
07/15/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,I’ve been here multiple times. Always great. I drive 4 hours mainly for this resteraunt.
07/15/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We celebrated a 50th Birthday.  Service was impeccable. Food was made to perfection. Cocktails were delicious as well.

Maybe it was where I was sitting, but who knows"
07/14/2023,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"The food was amazing, and I normally sit at the bar where the service is impeccable. It was my birthday and we sat in the restaurant , I have never had any issues with the service. however this particular waitress was not friendly and she seemed annoyed at any special
Requests."

The Wellington and Seafood Gratin were fantastic!"
07/14/2023,LeeB,5.0,"We were simply amazed with our perfectly WONDERFUL meals!  When I made our reservation, I mentioned that we would be dining on my husband's birthday. WOW! They gave him a birthday card signed by all of the staff AND Michael Jordan, too! Plus, we all shared a delicious brownie sundae! We have to give 5 STARS to the fantastic service and the outstanding meals!!"
07/12/2023,MaureenH,5.0,Absolutely wonderful! I enjoyed my birthday dinner at MJ’s. The filet was cooked perfectly. I was treated to a brownie sundae on the house followed by the 23-layer chocolate cake I had ordered. Fabulous!

07/10/2023,Yumyum,5.0,"Had the garlic bread, Porterhouse for 2 and swordfish with asparagus and potato as sides. Food was excellent quality, servers were attentive. 2 people, 2 drinks $230 before tip. Worth it."
07/10/2023,KayS,5.0,Absolutely delicious! We had a 10 oz filet mignon and the swordfish and were thrilled. The Mac and cheese was different but very good. There is no rice offered as a side but they happily did one for my husband anyway. Definitely would recommend if your looking for fine dining. On the pricey side but you get what you pay for.
07/10/2023,MichaelP,5.0,"Julie was the best. Attentive, helpful and good natured. We laughed a lot and had a great time."

06/29/2023,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"Server was excellent, garlic bread was awesome, Caesar salad was like end of lettuce you throw away. Filet was decent, cream sauce was tasty, but the 65 dollar seafood meal looked like stew and was small for the price. I understand this is a casino, but does not compare to other high end steakhouses ."
06/28/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Superb! Excellent service, nice atmosphere, excellent steaks, wine, Caesar salad delicious, bernaise sauce delicious. So good I decided to return 2 nights after for another dinner on the holiday weekend! One of my favorite steakhouses!  Very friendly and accommodating servers: all excellent."

Get the garlic bread with the fondue
Service is always attentive
Decor could us an upgrade
Must have reservations on weekends
Even with reservations they often run 10-15 min behind on the later time slots
Not cheap but what quality steak place is
Overall 20+ years of great steaks"

06/18/2023,Nelle,4.0,"the food & service was excellent. Danielle was very courteous & went out of her way to make certain we were happy. When she noticed that our meal was taking too long, she followed up with the chef & apologized & told us that our dinners were being plated at that time. In addition, she alerted the manager & he also apologized. He offered a complimentary dessert as an expression of gratitude. Regardless, it was a great Father's Day for my wonderful husband. The crab cakes are the best ever. Also, the chicken skewers are a great addition to the menu."
06/17/2023,BigRay,3.0,"The food & service were really good.  The noise level & the dress code (or lack of) was not commensurate with a 5-star priced restaurant experience.  Based on its location in a Casino, I was somewhat prepared.  However, I still left disappointed."
06/17/2023,PaulaW,5.0,"Gorgeous restaurant

Food was very good!!"
06/16/2023,Colleen,4.0,"The waitress was very good. We asked for additional rolls from the man who delivered our food, he said yes, but never came back. The food was very good. Should have told us the bottled water was a charge."
06/15/2023,Senior,4.0,The service was excellent. The value of the meal for the price I would say could have been better. Quality of the meal was very good but I would not rate it as excellent.
06/14/2023,MelissaH,4.0,It was good but not sure we will be back.  It is SO LOUD and it took forever to get our food.  It’s one thing to wait on great food but when you have to yell to hear your date or friend it becomes obnoxious.  The cocktails were delicious food was great and the staff was super nice I just wish we could have heard each other and also it was freezing so being a jacket ladies.

06/11/2023,MariaM,5.0,"The food here is undeniably pricey - but equally undeniably delicious. The service was friendly while very professional if a little bit slow.  The wine list is expansive and  had some good moderately priced bottles for those of us on (somewhat of) a budget.  The Mohegan sun is a pretty remarkable setting and although the casino is a little bit of sensory overload, the steak house was a much quieter corner to enjoy a really delicious meal.  Would recommend, would return. For 2 of us - 2 steaks, an app, 2 sides, a bottle of wine, 2 desserts and 2 cappuccinos came to just over 300.00"
06/11/2023,MargaretL,5.0,Awesome as always! Never a bad meal and service is top notch

Perfect Filet Mignon, loved the mashed potato trio, we enjoyed the mushrooms (and were so glad the sides are made shareable) service and recommendations were perfect.   Honestly the whole experience was very high class and stellar.  We’d be happy to come back."

05/28/2023,LaurieM,4.0,My boyfriend only had one complaint.  Everything had a little to much salt for his taste.

The only thing that would have been more exciting is Michael Jordan showing up xo We we’re celebrating our 44 th wedding Anniversary and my birthday! We will be coming back to MJs soon Thank you"
05/26/2023,stephanieM,5.0,"so awesome, we were 45 mins late because of traffic, we called ahead and they moved our reservation without any issues. Staff was amazing, food delicious. We were celebrating our anniversary, and when we got to the table there were 2 glasses of champion waiting for us and card from the staff. Definitely seemed to go above and beyond."
05/26/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Been to MJs steakhouse at Mohegan many times and it’s  always good but last nights service, food and overall experience was exceptional!"

Our bartender Brad got our dinner started with champagne. This place is top notch 20+ years later and is still our restaurant we choose to celebrate special occasions. Yeah it’s a little pricey but the quality is worth it. We visited on a Saturday night and the restaurant (and casino) was packed. It was a little noisy, but it was also Saturday. Great job by everyone. Thank you"

05/06/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Came here for dinner one night on a quick baby-moon weekend away. We splurged and got one of the steak flights. It was amazing! Highly recommend. Also love they have alcohol-free options since I can’t drink until after the pregnancy. We went to a couple other places that didn’t have any menu options and I only had water or soda as an option (which is fine, but I do like to switch it up sometimes)."

04/29/2023,KimK,5.0,"Chris and his partner were AMAZING! Kind, polite, quick & knowledgeable.  Looking forward to our next visit..Cheers! 
The Kaczmarcyks's"
04/29/2023,KathrynK,2.0,"Steak was ordered medium rare but was served well done. Server didn't apologize but did offer to have it recooked. They recooked the steak, but I received a different cut than I originally ordered, and it still was served slightly overcooked.  For the price that they charge I expect that the food is cooked perfectly, and the server have a better personality. The fact is, they are in a high volume location and will get business regardless of reviews, however, hopefully if someone sees this, they will save themselves from having a disappointing, overpriced experience."
04/29/2023,CharC,5.0,Amazing as always! Our waiter was awesome and the food was top notch!!

04/27/2023,KathyC,4.0,"The atmosphere was good and the bartenders attentive.  We stopped in before a concert for a drink and some apps.  We ordered garlic bread, a crab cake, a glass of wine and a mixed drink.  The bill with tip came to almost $100.  I think that's a bit expensive for what we had.  Next time we will think twice about coming to this restaurant."
04/27/2023,RalphT,5.0,Food was very good - waitstaff were helpful and friendly.  I would eat here again.
04/26/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Outstanding food and service!  Perfect for any special occasion!!

Food was good but the delay In service means I probably will not return."

04/23/2023,LukeP,5.0,Service at MJ's was perfect.  It was our anniversary and the waiter brought over a couple of glasses of champagne. Nice touch.  We were never rushed and never felt like we were waiting for service of any kind.  The steaks were cooked perfectly and tasted great.

04/22/2023,Diddy,4.0,"Great food, obviously price a bit higher than the norm being that it's in a casino. We had the porterhouse for 2 and the potatoes trio. Steak was perfectly cooked, and the potatoes were very tasty. We also had the salad wedge, which was huge, so I split it with my wife. Had to still wait like 20 minutes even though we had reservations from two weeks prior. The ladies at the front desk were very professional and seemed to be handling the wave of people coming in pretty well. Our waitress was pretty good, just disappeared a few times during our dinner. We will definitely return in the future. It's a great 3rd experience all in all at this location."
04/22/2023,FRANCOC,5.0,Excellent food service and quality.  Premium product but be prepared for premium price.  Worth it imo.

04/20/2023,BRIANS,4.0,"We Usually Go To The Connecticut MJ Steakhouse 2-3 A Year, It’s Usually Great, But I Surprised This Time Around, My Wife And I Ordered The Same 10oz Filet, Both Cooked Medium, Hers Was Ok But my Steak Was Well Done, And Was Seared (Crispy) On The Top, No Pink So It Was Overdone. Very Surprised Given What It Cost., I Didn’t Complain (Although I Know I Should’ve) Everything Else Was Good."

04/15/2023,PaulaC,5.0,"We were at Mohegan for a Pat Benatar concert on our 29th anniversary and decided to dine at Michael Jordan Steakhouse.  We were greeted right away and the hostess wished us a Happy Anniversary.  Right away I was impressed by the attention to detail.  We were brought to our table and presented with an anniversary card signed by the staff.. another nice touch.  After promptly being served water and bread, we were greeted by our server.  She was awesome.  She had a very vast knowledge of the menu and was able to answer questions and give us recommendations.  After taking our order, she came back and served us complimentary champagne!  The meal was outstanding - everything cooked properly and was absolutely delicious.  We both had the filet mignon and we shared a wedge salad and the asparagus & loaded baked potato sides.  With no room for dessert, we left to go enjoy the show.  We would love to visit again next time we are at Mohegan Sun.  Fabulous meal and experience!"
04/15/2023,VincentC,5.0,MJ's Steakhouse is my favorite restaurant at Mohegan Sun.  I've dined there multiple times and have always had a positive experience.  Great food and service!

04/15/2023,DavidS,3.0,Wavgu steak … very expensive. Major grizzle throughout. It was horrible. Don’t know what chef was thinking to serve?
04/15/2023,Jess2,5.0,"Sarah was AMAZING, she was attentive, pleasant and extremely knowledgeable about the food and drinks.  We had the Porterhouse for 2 for the first time and it was out of this world!  The Mac & Cheese is the best I’ve ever had!!!"
04/14/2023,MealB4SHO,5.0,We celebrated our 17th wedding anniversary and enjoyed every minute of our visit!  Our first time here and we will definitely be back!!!
04/14/2023,KathyK,4.0,"Great food, great service but very pricey.  A little dark too, hard to read the menu. The trio potato side dish was very good, enough to share with two people. Drinks were good too but charged extra $2.00 for Lemon Drop martini as a specialty drink on top of the price. Filet mignon was delicious, along with Brussels sprouts side that we shared as well."
04/14/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Birthday dinner. Staff was amazing! Food was great as usual.
04/14/2023,Barney,4.0,We have been to MJ's many times and always have a great time. Service was a little slow as it was very busy. Our server was warm and friendly. Unfortunately the meal we come all the way to MJ's went up $20.00 in 3 months. I do think for that price at least one side or salad should be included. Our meals were made perfectly and our compliments to the chefs. We choose the Bone in Ribeye.
04/14/2023,JohnC,5.0,Excellent service. My wife and I shared a tomahawk steak. It was cooked perfectly. Side dishes were excellent as well.
04/13/2023,CourtneyL,5.0,Everything from the water to the dessert was absolutely amazing! This place never disappoints

04/12/2023,DonnaT,4.0,Excellent food and service. Disappointed the ambiance was not more conducive to a leisurely dinner. It was too chain restaurant atmosphere and didn’t expect that.
04/11/2023,LauraD,5.0,We always love this amazing restaurant and again no disappointment from beginning to end!
04/10/2023,ashleyp,5.0,Beautiful ambiance with wonderful food and service! Highly recommend
04/09/2023,SteveP,5.0,our server was excellent!!! I believe her name was Simone.  Ask for her as your server...won't regret
04/09/2023,Tialette,5.0,I love coming to Michael Jordans restaurant. The service is always amazing and helpful. The food is delicious every single time.
04/09/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Perfect in every way.  Seated promptly at a larger banquette. Friendly and prompt service from our waitress and all other servers. Food was delish.
04/09/2023,TonyM,4.0,"Great Dinner, just a little unhappy that my 10oz Filet was the same size as my Wife’s Petite 7oz Filet."
04/09/2023,LouisC,3.0,"We had a reservation for 8 pm we were going to be seated at a small table for two we asked if there was a possibility of getting a booth the hostess said yes they are cleaning it off will be a moment so we were to hang out at the hostess stand only to be told that the table was reserved for someone else, so they seated us in a high top in the entrance way. Fist off, it is extremely noise in that area more part of the bar not really what we would call a date night. Cocktail & wine were good. Service was mediocre. 
 Food was not good at all steaks were dry and chew my husband couldn’t even cut his. Overpriced and not food quality will not be returning."
04/08/2023,KMM0223,5.0,"Great meal , waitstaff attentive and helpful! Definitely would return !"
04/08/2023,MelindaB,4.0,"The food is very good, but that was the most expensive steak I’ve ever seen on the menu.  I found the hostess off putting by being greeted with “Can I discard those for you? If not wait outside until they are done”.  I get you want us to buy your beverages but to me that came off as rude.  Not sure I will be back."
04/07/2023,Christian,5.0,Excellent! Only issue was that MJ wasn’t there! Lol
04/07/2023,TommyC,5.0,"Great Dinner ! Food was Great, Our Server Robert was outstanding and Atmosphere was Awesome. We will be back again soon."

But still A+"
04/05/2023,SusanS,5.0,"As always, Michael Jordan’s did not disappoint! Having the pork chop back on the menu was a plus!  It was delicious!
Robert, our server, was exceptional, he was always ready to serve us."
04/04/2023,OTfan,5.0,"OMG!  Where do I start?  Michael Jordan's Steakhouse is the best restaurant at Mohegan Sun!  This is our special occasion place.  We do regularly go to the MJ 23 Sports Bar and Grill next door.  It is really good too.  The steakhouse is their top tier restaurant at Mohegan Sun.

They fussed over us as they always do.  Service is key to their operation and they don't disappoint!  The waitstaff is amazing!  Friendly, unobtrusive, and very efficient.  They know the menu, and wines, inside and out.  VERY well trained staff.

We had the Tomahawk Rib-eye on the bone and it was plenty for the 3 of us to eat.  The sides are amazing!  You absolutely have to try the Garlic Bread with the Blue Cheese Fondue sauce.  It is the most amazing Garlic Bread I have ever had.  

The Brussels Sprouts, Mashed Trio, Mushrooms, and Asparagus are also amazing and delicious!

You are paying top dollar at the restaurant but the food quality, service, and preparation more than justify the price!

If you go, you won't be sorry."
04/02/2023,SeanN,5.0,We are from Baltimore and crab cakes was amazing.
04/02/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"All around fantastic, everything was great and we will be back"
04/01/2023,StephTony,5.0,"We had the MVP and everything was delicious! Ordered Brussels to share and half a lobster as an add on. Really pleasant and attentive, but not overbearing, wait staff. 
Made a reservation he would highly recommend doing so!"
03/25/2023,MICHAELD,2.0,the TABLE WE WERE SEATED AT WAS POOR. made A RSERVATION MANY WEKS IN ADVANCE. TABLE WAS IN THE CORNER SO PEOPLE CONSTANTLY HAD TO BRUSH MY BACK TO GET BY . VERY DISAPOINTED.
03/25/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"I always look forward to going to Michael Jordan’s at Mohegan sun. The food is amazing, it’s not priced bad when you share the plates with everyone else you go with. One of the best places to eat in my opinion at Mohegan sun for a more formal dinner."
03/25/2023,Jayrodf,5.0,"Got the steakmanship legendary flight, delicious and reasonably priced for the amount of food and ofcourse the garlic bread fondue is always a hit, can't wait to go back"
03/24/2023,KristenD,5.0,"Excellent experience.  Server was very nice. We had the bread fondue, trio of mashed potatoes & the filet minon.  Hands down, one of the best steaks we've had.  The garlic butter was SO good.  We'll definitely be back!"

03/23/2023,Hokie,5.0,Food was amazing and the wait staff were excellent.
03/22/2023,kevin,5.0,Loved the garlic bread that I got first. Had the 10 ounce filet steak and was cooked exactly to my liking. The french fries that I had were cooked to my liking as well. Loved the lighting in the restaurant. Would recommend this restaurant for a couple that want a quiet and romantic dinner.
03/22/2023,MarthaP,5.0,"I brought my gentleman friend for his birthday. I wanted a great restaurant that would serve some of his favorite foods. MJ's accommodated my requests, service was spectacular! Jen our server could not have been nicer! Everyone wished him a happy birthday from the host to the backserver and manager making him feel very special. We went all out, it was certainly pricey but delicious. I always recommend MJ's especially for special occasions!"
03/21/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great bar service today March 21st.  Super personable and took great care of us.  Thank you!!
03/21/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Celebrated my husbands 50th birthday on 3/21/23. Service was fantastic!  Food was amazing and wine selection was perfect!  I had the swordfish and it was outstanding!!!  My husband had the 10 oz. filet and it was cooked to perfection. The garlic bread is to die for every single time. The shrimp cocktail was meaty and delicious. We had macaroni & cheese and Brussels sprouts for our sides and they were so good!  Dessert!  They gave my husband a brownie sundae with a candle which was sweet. We also ordered the baked Alaska. Do not miss that. It was phenomenal!  We had a nice little secluded booth and couldn’t have asked for more!
03/20/2023,GarryL,5.0,"Excellent filet mignon, melted in my mouth. Service was exceptional."
03/20/2023,Jangz,2.0,Great service clean environment however completely overpriced. For $100 steak I want to be blown away and ive had a better cheaper steak at an Outback. I will not be coming back.
03/19/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Food service ambiance and manager was great! Can’t wait to come back!
03/19/2023,kmack,4.0,Steaks were excellent and cooked perfectly. Only downside was table not being ready until 30 minutes after our registration time.
03/19/2023,CEG88,3.0,"We usually go to David Burke Prime at Foxwoods but because we were at Mohegan decided to give this restaurant a try. It was alright but not amazing. My cocktail (Violet Muse) was beautiful but tasted like children’s robitussin. The bacon appetizer was more like pork belly than a true thick cut bacon. Both of our steaks and sides were excellent, and perfectly cooked, however. I would give it another chance if we happen to be at Mohegan but would order different drinks/apps."
03/19/2023,BandC,5.0,Tuna tartare. Wonderful. 7 oz Filet delicious.  Server Brian great!
03/19/2023,JimK,5.0,"Fantastic !! The food was great  and the waiter was great ,"
03/18/2023,Betsy,5.0,It was my birthday and I had such a nice time very lovely and a very nice memory
03/18/2023,JoeU,5.0,Mj’s has always provided an excellent meal and great customer service. This visit was a little louder than usual because of numerous birthdays located near us but all and all a good time
03/17/2023,Margie,3.0,Waited for a table even though had a reservation for 7:30. Ordered a steak special for two and waited a very long time for it to be served. Waiter was kind and helpful but he was very busy (waiting on other tables?) because he would be gone for long intervals. The steak was disappointing - overly chewy. Was not expecting the let down as this restaurant did not disappoint in the past. It was very noisy too. A table of five behind us were screaming and cheering at the top of their voices. Ended up missing the first part of the concert we came to see due to the long waits for seating and being served.
03/17/2023,RosalieB,5.0,Amazing as always. Kyle the manager awesome and friendly. As per usual we requested our waiter Chris. He is awesome! Always our go to. Delish and top shelf
03/17/2023,StacyA,5.0,The food was absolutely fantastic and the service was outstanding!
03/16/2023,Brie,1.0,"Walking into the restaurant it is beautiful and we were seated promptly. Then we were greeted by our server and after that there was nothing positive to say about our experience. My boyfriends steak was ordered medium, and he received a rare steak. I Ordered the wagyu and not only was it extremely difficult to chew but over 30% of the steak was fat. Things happen and I am very understanding it will not always be perfect, but there was clearly chewed steak on my plate and the server can blatantly see that his steak is significantly undercooked. The manager took back my steak and said that it could have just been that cut of meat, but proceeded to say nothing about my boyfriends. The server also stated that because the restaurant was in a casino it was guaranteed traffic. Although that is a fact, it does not mean that the service should lack. I ordered two half bottles of Moscato. The waiter came over to our table multiple times and saw the glass empty which he proceeded to not fill from the bottle on the table, so I poured my drinks for myself. Our waters were never refilled as well. To be quite honest, It felt as if they just didn't care. I am huge into the restaurant scene and the ambiance was wonderful, but the food as well as service here were far below subpar and an absolute waste of money. There is a 0% chance I would ever return."
03/16/2023,LoriP,5.0,Delicious food!!  Filet is always cooked exactly as ordered.  The Creme' Brulle  is to die for.  I am always very pleased with the dining experience at Michael Jordans.
03/16/2023,ThomasP,5.0,Best restaurant for steaks.  Always excellent and never disappoints.  Always done perfectly as requested.  Please bring back the grilled corn.
03/16/2023,NatashaC,4.0,"Hostess and female waiters were very friendly and welcoming, can't say the same for the male waiters. My meat was not fully cooked at first as requested. The manager was friendly and helpful. Overall, after the hiccups it was a nice dining experience!"
03/15/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,A nice atmosphere. Great food. The staff was very friendly... Brian was our server who was very attentive. Highly recommend!
03/14/2023,MarkK,5.0,"Great restaurant!  Service was perfect, food was delicious.  Will definitely be going back again on my future trips."
03/13/2023,Rockstar92,5.0,"Everything was so delicious! Haven’t been back here in many years, but everything was just so good! Fun to celebrate my husband’s birthday!"
03/13/2023,sedaly88,5.0,"Fantastic evening, dinner was amazing.  My husband and I each had a salad (could have split because the size was generous) and then each had steaks.  My husband had the Delmonico, it was cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, and top quality.  I had the Bone in Strip and all of the same was true, cooked and seasoned perfectly and top quality tender.  The cocktails were delicious, I highly recommend their Autumn Sangria, best Sangria I have ever had with a spin on an old fashioned which was super fun. 

Tim and the rest of the crew at the bar gave top notch and personable service.  We can't wait to go back!"
03/12/2023,BrynW,4.0,"Good food, nothing spectacular. Good atmosphere. good service but for the price ehh."
03/12/2023,JamieC,5.0,"Wonderful as always. The service is impeccable and the food delicious.
We had an early reservation due to a show and the restaurant was very quiet, which was nice, as it can get loud at times."
03/12/2023,Mike,3.0,"In my opinion going by our most recent visits the restaurant was better before the remodel. 

Changes since that need improvement:
Longer wait times after being seated to be acknowledged 
Lobster mash potatoes no longer offered
Little to no weekend specials
Menu missing typical steakhouse offerings and toppings
Refresh on cocktail selection/drink specials 
Desert menu needs improvement
Inconsistent cooking

Our last two visits both had issues:
We chose the meatballs for app and they were severed undercooked. 
Filet was served on the cold side and bland.

I don’t remember having consistency issues before the renovation. On the positive side the Baked Alaska is always on point and fantastic."
03/12/2023,Stephk,5.0,The entire staff made my boyfriends 30th birthday feel so special. The attention to detail was immaculate.
03/12/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Food was delicious and the staff was amazing and very helpful!
03/11/2023,terig,5.0,"My husband and I enjoyed my birthday dinner on a busy Saturday night.  The food was delicious and plentiful-porterhouse steak for two was cooked to perfection.  Thanks to our waitress Monique and assistant Taylor - both attentive and personable- for the impeccable service. 
It was also nice to meet Dallas Beasley, general manager, who stopped by our table."
03/11/2023,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Unfortunately, the food wasn’t up to the challenge. My steak was no better than what I make at home. And menu choices were a bit limited for a steakhouse."
03/11/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We have been here many times over the years.. it’s our dinner choice when we come to Mohegan Sun.. When I made the reservation I mentioned it was our wedding anniversary.. when we arrived at the restaurant the hostess seated us and wished us a happy anniversary… our server Nikki was great throughout the entire meal .. she brought us 2 complimentary glasses of champagne and an anniversary card signed by some of the employees.. our meal here is never disappointing.. alway delicious.. Thank you for a great anniversary dinner..
03/10/2023,vman465,5.0,Delicious dinner! Nice upscale restaurant. Waiter was very nice but a couple of mistakes were made in reference to our food preparation but it was easily resolved by manager. Recommend if you enjoy different cuts of steak.
03/08/2023,SallyE,5.0,The steak special was way too salty for both of us. I let the person who cleared the table about the salt and he said he would covey it to the chef. That's the first time I have ever had to make a not so good recommendation.
03/08/2023,SusanS,5.0,Once again the food and service were exceptional!  Thanks to Amanda for making our dinner wonderful!
03/07/2023,StellaJane0134,3.0,"Went there for my 25th wedding anniversary.  It was a Tuesday night, there was my husband and i and one other two top there.  Drinks were good however no merlot.... weird.  The filets were good a little bland even with the bleu cheese crust we added on each. It was pretty skimpy and for $5 on each it should have a bit more. Waitress was very friendly however dinner seemed to take a long time and the cream spinach side was decent but not warm.  I has the bleu cheese wedge which was fair.  The pickled onions ruin it. Maybe some fried thin onions would be nice.  The pickled ones just seem to ruin it. Anyway for the most part we enjoyed our night."
03/06/2023,Susan4,5.0,"I always visit this restaurant when i’m at Mohegan Sun, great food and service."
03/05/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Waiter and staff were very attentive and friendly! Food was great! It was a little noisy but that was beyond their control. Overall a wonderful date night.

02/26/2023,Noone,4.0,While we enjoyed our dinner at Michael Jordan's Steak House we did not feel the experience justified the prices.

02/22/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Waitress Melissa was fantastic. She was well versed in menu and specials. Excellent demeanor and what was nice was as she went over the specials she informed us of the price. I highly recommend the Crab cake at 40.00 it seemed like a lot but the portion was very healthy. We also splurged for the appetizer wagu beef ; it too was a very nice size for the price.
02/22/2023,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Food was average. Was disappointed in the lobster bisque soup. Thought it should be cream based. Our server was very good:)
02/21/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Our dining experience was nothing short of amazing ! From the hostess who greeted us to the friendly bartender who made us espresso martinis with Michael Jordan insignia we felt special from the moment we walked in.  Our waitress Sarah was super sweet and the food —- omg —- it was beyond delicious.  I will be dreaming about that garlic bread in the blue cheese sauce , and our steaks were perfectly cooked and so good!"

My favorite place to go every year for my birthday."
02/20/2023,christineg,3.0,"Food was excellent as always. My server Ryan basically ignored us. It took an hour to get our food and if it was for the manager Dallas asking how everything was we would have waited longer. Dallas was prompt for getting us our food. We ate here Saturday as well on Saturday my water glass was never empty not so for Sunday. I was asked about food allergies on Saturday that did not happen on Sunday. The ladies who took care of us on Saturday were great, very attentive, Sunday was a huge disappointment. We will definitely eat here again but will request that Ryan not be our server."
02/20/2023,DennisE,5.0,Shout out to Michael Jordan’s steakhouse staff! They was terrific! Our waiter Chris was great! Ordered the tomahawk steak last time we went and yesterday….SUPERB!! Want great food and vibe….Michael Jordan’s steakhouse is it!!!

02/15/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great Valentines Day dinner! Thank you.
02/15/2023,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"Went for valentines dinner.  My husband got a steak.  I got lobster tail, side of Mac and cheese, mashed potato flight and salad.  Food was bland salad soaked in dressing and steak was greasy.  Very disappointed.  We have been to better steakhouses for half the price"
02/14/2023,DesiraeR,5.0,I am never disappointed with the food or the service at MJs ! Everything was wonderful!
02/13/2023,VeraL,5.0,"Excellent all around!!
Manager was very accommodating!!!"
02/13/2023,Maggie,5.0,"Our meal was delicious, everything was cooked to our liking! Side order portions were much larger than expected, as fine dining does not usually offer large portions on side dishes.
The meal was paced perfectly, each course was able to be completed before the next arrived at the table, with the food still being fresh - it was clear it was not held under heat lamps in order to wait for things to be cleared from the table before serving it.
Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and offered suggestions and answered any questions we had.
Overall an enjoyable experience and we will visit again in the future."
02/13/2023,SonnyC,5.0,"Steaks were excellent, garlic bread not to be missed, baked potato was huge and with great toppings ask for all the toppings). Couldn't get to the desserts. You need to be very hungry or be prepared to bring stuff home."
02/13/2023,DonE,5.0,Food selection is great food was cooked to temp fast and friendly service
02/13/2023,HannahD,3.0,"The service was ok, depending on who you have. But the food was not up to expectation."
02/12/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"This is the third time I’ve been here and we absolutely love it. The food is absolutely amazing, the service is amazing! The staff is also super friendly. We have gone when it was busy and it was still a great experience. However last night we arrived at 4pm and it was calm and quiet."
02/12/2023,BonnieL,4.0,"Not as good as I remember it. Very good but went down a little bit in a couple years. One of my favorite items, the garlic bread fondue was a little bland this time. Almost watered down."
02/11/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,A very nice experience was had by my wife and I. My wife enjoyed her salmon and cocktails maybe a little too much..lol I had the NY Strip which was cooked perfectly. Our server Allison was very gracious as well as her co server Rolando. Thank you for the hospitality.
02/10/2023,OpenTable Diner,1.0,Food was mediocre. My server barely came to the table and it took 11 mins to order apps and drinks.
02/10/2023,RickR,5.0,Bartenders are great! I would eat and drink at the bar anytime.
02/08/2023,rondog,3.0,"Way way way too loud …. Good very good … our service was good UNTIL they delivered the entrees..  then after that no one was there to be found …. Actually had to go to host stand to close out check … really a shame because the service ruined the experience….
Janine was our server …
Also it was busy ,  and extremely loud … that is what it is ..   service was a complete FAILURE."
02/08/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food was perfect the service was impeccable. They were attentive and prompt. Seriously probably haven’t had better service. I don’t believe an empty plate was on the table greater than 2 minutes. Just a great experience and very happy we went.
02/06/2023,huge,4.0,"Our waiter. Brian was fine, but the bus staff was a little slow to clear plates. The shrimp was horrible and not recommended."
02/05/2023,OpenTable Diner,4.0,The night was for my birthday. My steak was a little overcooked but the mad and cheese and potato trio almost made up for it. I’d like to go back someday but I would have to be very specific with my meat temperature choice. My server was awesome though!
02/04/2023,BiancaB,5.0,The food is amazing and the service is truly perfect!
02/04/2023,AndrewK,5.0,Great place for great food .. nice atmosphere and service was excellent.
02/04/2023,EricW,5.0,One of us were late for our reservation. The staff gave us another reservation  for a hour later. Plenty to choose from on the menu. Food was great. staff was super friendly
02/04/2023,OpenTable Diner,4.0,I didn’t like the new menu as much.  It usually is better
02/04/2023,JaniceM,5.0,The food is outstanding and the service is excellent. The staff goes out of their way to make you feel special and are very attentive. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone that enjoys a good meal and enjoyable experience  I have been to this location several times a year and have always enjoyed the food and atmosphere
01/31/2023,OpenTable Diner,1.0,Celebrating our anniversary and was destroyed by poor service and food. Main course delivered approximately 1 hr after appetizers and was incorrectly prepped and ice cold! Service was delayed so long that the toppings on side dishes had congealed into a paste. Truly a horrible dining experience.
01/29/2023,JulieC,5.0,Awesome night!! Dallas greeted us right away and couldn't be any nicer. Our steak and chicken dishes were cooked to perfection. Our waiter Chris was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave top notch service. Excellent experience!!

01/28/2023,Brianna,5.0,"Excellent food, cooked to perfection in every way. Wonderful waitstaff, very attentive."
01/28/2023,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"I booked dinner for 2 at 5:30 pm a month in advance.  My wife and I were going to a concert later in the evening, so I booked early enough to make the show.  We were seated at a small round table in the reception area - absolutely ridiculous for a $200+ meal.  The service was slow, and the server came by only once after we were served to check on the meal.

The lobster bisque tasted like tomato soup.  The wedge salad I had was good, and the steak (prime ribeye) we split was cooked well and tasted good.

The food was ok, not great, atmosphere was awful, and the service was subpar. Huge disappointment.  Tuscany or Ballo much better options at Mohegan Sun."
01/28/2023,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Outstanding overall.  Great service.  We thought the bread didn’t live up to the quality that came with the rest of the dinner.  Also the octopus needed to be grilled much more than it was.  Steak was outstanding.
01/27/2023,ThomasG,5.0,"We had a wonderful experience! Our serving team of Kate & Katie was outstanding! Kate guided us through the menu she made valuable suggestions which enhanced our dining experience!

Great food, impressive wine selection, impeccable service…what more could we want!"
01/27/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The steakhouse was amazing! We were there for our anniversary and they greeted us on that way and gave us a signed anniversary card, very nice! The staff was extremely friendly and the food was delicious! Thank you!!"
01/26/2023,BobZ,4.0,The steak was very good but the mushrooms were just ok.  Very noisy and lighting at our table was very low.  Some tables were very well lit and others were dark.  Our waiter was great.
01/26/2023,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"Definitely a pass in the future. The staff is not for an upscale restaurant and doesn’t care about the guests.
The food is not good and corporate.
The baked Alaska was a horrible premade at a factory dessert.
Michael Jordan would be embarrassed this restaurant carrys his name.
Over priced bad food…."
01/25/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellent experience all the way. A Team! Highly recommend.

01/19/2023,JanetR,1.0,"Shrimp cocktail was slimy looking and rubbery.  Wife's filet mignon was well done
even though she requested medium rare.  Replacement filet was properly cooked
but tough.  How does one even find a tough filet mignon.
If they weren't the only steak house there they would be out of business."
01/18/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Delicious steaks. Comfortable booths. Drinks are outstanding. Looking forward to going again!!
01/18/2023,SusanS,5.0,"Amanda, our server, was excellent as always!! Food was great as always!!"

01/16/2023,VincentR,3.0,"We all had the Filet which was cooked perfectly and very good.  But as for the sides we found everything a little too salty for our taste.  Overall, it was ok but definitely not worth what we had paid for our meal."
01/16/2023,CathrynS,5.0,"We were celebrating our anniversary, and they made it incredibly special."
01/15/2023,TanyaD,3.0,"The noise level made it unenjoyable. For the high ticket price of this place i expect low noise levels and this place was like being in a buffalo wild wings.  The Kobe beef was actually terrible. I expected a smooth, juicy steak. I got a high quality grocery store steak cooked on a backyard grill. I expected much better. I was very shocked how low quality it was in taste and experience.  Sent it back for a ribeye and that was salty and very unwowing. I shoulda ordered the Del Monaco.  What a shame."
01/15/2023,Nina,5.0,"one of my favorite restaurants, I have never had a better crab cake or garlic bread with blue cheese, have made a lot of memories here, will keep coming back."
01/15/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Food was fantastic.  Service was little slow but they were very busy.  Really enjoyed this  restaurant.
01/14/2023,Katie,5.0,"Michael Jordan's is a very good experience. Excellent food and amazing table service. However, they are always running at least 25-45 mins late on reservations. Something to keep in mind when you book."

01/09/2023,brucej,5.0,we were a table of three at 6:00 on the 9th.      everything was great for sure.    cannot remember the young lady that served us but her service was outstanding.   That is exactly the type of person i would want representing my company.    great dining experience.
01/09/2023,SamanthaN,5.0,Excellent service and food. The wait staff was very attentive. Service was a 10/10 and the food was Devine .

01/09/2023,RenatoB,5.0,"Just ask the servers to be aware when the customer is having an important conversation (my gf and I were planning our wedding), try if possible not to interrupt with the check or anything else."
01/08/2023,Blklab,5.0,"This is probably our 50th time there at least. We love it.. Service is always good. Food is always delicious and consistent and the crazy thing is the servers. A lot of them have been there for like 17 years 12 years for a long time, so obviously, it’s a great place to work for them which says a lot!"

01/03/2023,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Me and my boyfriend decided to come here for my birthday dinner and the food honestly was amazing. Our waiter Robert was excellent and made us feel welcomed. We had the Jordan 23 flight and a few apps and it was delicious. 10/10 recommend
01/03/2023,EllaP,5.0,"Everything was perfect, service and food! We normally get the lobster bisque but this time I decided on the beet salad. Seemed like an odd combination but OH MY GOODNESS, this was simply delicious and so refreshing. Previous visit we tried the meatballs, not a fan. Maybe an off night but just not good. The New York strip (extra pickeled garlic), mac and cheese and brussel sprouts rounded the meal off. I didn't plan on getting dessert but took home a slice of the key lime pie. Smartest thing I did, it was a great snack! This has been my pick for special occasions as well, they make it all so special. Appreciate Dallas and his amazing team, be back soon! 

Don't stay away because of diet restrictions, they make that a priority and can modify just about everything.

Happy New Year to all!"
01/02/2023,MommaT,5.0,"1/2/23-We celebrated our 30th Anniversary at MJS and we were very pleased.
From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by extremely polite and friendly staff. They congratulated us on our anniversary while escorting us to a very private table where an anniversary card, signed by the MJS staffers was waiting! We also received a complimentary Prosecco toast!
We tried the Garlic Bread appetizer with bleu cheese fondue- delicious!! My husband tried their Fall Fashioned seasonal spin on the old fashioned and said it was nicely made. He also tried their house margarita which he enjoyed.
We dined on NY Strip, cooked perfectly at medium well. I had the 7 oz Filet Mignon cooked to medium, which was almost perfect- about 1/2 was medium rare; I don’t mind as it reheats nicely.
We tried the asparagus for two & the trio of mashed potatoes for two.
Dessert and after dinner cocktails were offered, however we were too full.
Our server Amanda was extremely cordial and answered all our questions with a smile.
We overheard a table near us ask and receive a military discount, so if this applies to your situation, they honor your service.

Overall, it was a lovely experience. Since we could not be in our hometown for our celebration, we were pleased with MJS & the attention to detail we experienced!
Thank you for a lovely evening!
Sherri & Mike T."
01/01/2023,CelesteC,5.0,"We booked for girls night NYE, our experience was great. Our waitress was attentive and full of personality. Our food was cooked to perfection, hot and served in a timely manner. Being that it was NYE, the noise level was moderate but it was a great time at the restaurant. Crab cake is top tier and that blue cheese fondue, chefs kiss. We shared a platter with a wide variety. Highly recommend, MJ’s doesn’t miss!"
01/01/2023,MichelleM,5.0,Food is always amazing. Never had a bad meal! Recommended !
01/01/2023,Rocky,5.0,"As always the dinner at Michael Jordans was fantastic on 12/30 and even on 12/31 which is a rare for any restaurant  to be on top of their game New Years Eve. Most restaurants  have limited menus and most of the time things are not like you ordered. But MJs is always fantastic . The management, staff, service and the food is always the best. We have gone there for a number of New Years eve's and can't imagine going anywhere else. The New York Strip and the Filet Mignon were cooked to perfection. We can't thank Dallas and the staff enough for everything. GREAT PEOPLE ."
12/31/2022,Schnagle,4.0,The food is very pricey and you don't get alot. Might depend on what you order. It is very noisy in the restaurant. The people that work there are very attentive.  Overall we were satisfied.

12/30/2022,Kimc,4.0,"Our booth was roomy and quiet!  The shrimp cocktail is fantastic. The service is rushed, it’s not a long relaxing meal. The filet mignon is dry. The potato trio was very good, they should bring back the lobster mashed potatoes! The Brussels sprouts were ok, not great. The kanas city steak tasted like a steak from outback, not impressed. It’s great for a nice dinner at the casino, but there are much better steak houses that are a lot better!"
12/30/2022,DaveS,5.0,Service was outstanding and our steak were cooked exactly like we wanted them!

12/28/2022,BrianC,5.0,"Went there for my wife's birthday. I requested online to be placed in one of their private booths. I didn't even need to mention that to the hostess, she walked us right there and even opened the table for us to easily sit in. Severs were very attentive and food was amazing. A top steak house that is consistently phenomenal. (We go there a few times a year since 2015)"
12/28/2022,WesleyJ,5.0,Service by Melissa and busboy was exceptional! The busboy was friendly and went out of his way to surprise our son with the Michael Jordan NBA championship rings!
12/28/2022,MarijanP,2.0,"Have been many times and everything has been outstanding, this time not so good. One diner had filet that was undercooked, another had chicken that was dry, and I had ordered the special which was the eye of the rib eye, but was very tough, more like an eye round roast and not a steak. Also service was slow and sides did not come out with meals at the same time, but 5 minutes later. Also spoke to one of the black Jack dealers that said that I was not the only one to complain about their experience that night. Normally things are great, but not this night, 12/27/22."
12/28/2022,Jcwrestlar,5.0,"Steak was fantastic. Got the porterhouse for two. Medium rare with a garlic Parmesan crust. Delicious. The garlic bread with bleu cheese was a great start. The dessert was pretty good, but hard to fit it after everything else. Would definitely go back. Our server was helpful and friendly. Kept our glasses full without having to ask."

12/15/2022,PatriciaL,3.0,"Service was excellent, as always, but we thoroughly enjoyed our server.  We ordered the VIP meat platter, ordered everything medium rare, it all came over cooked at medium at best.  We did eat some but not much.  We did tell our server and management took off the $60 bottle of wine; the platter was $270, I guess we should be happy with that.  :-("
12/13/2022,Jo123,5.0,"I took my granddaughter to dinner at Michael Jordan’s prior to some Christmas shopping, and it’s going to be our new tradition. We were greeted with smiles, and seated at a booth. Our server Sarah her assistant Aracely were fantastic. We went with all their recommendations. From the garlic bread to the baked Alaska everything was 10/10. The manager, Dallas even came by to ensure we enjoyed our meals. We can’t wait for our next visit!"
12/13/2022,TamaraJ,5.0,The staff was so friendly and accommodating. It was dinner for 2 and we were able to enjoy each others company. The staff gave great food recommendations. Amazing ambiance for a romantic birthday dinner.
12/12/2022,MissMi,5.0,"Had an awesome server, Tanya. She really knew how to sell particular food items and had a friendly demeanor along with his popular food items tasted. Overall great experience. One thing I would do differently is offer a piece of cake or drink for birthday treat"
12/12/2022,marionc,5.0,"Cancelled Tao due to noise level. MJ always what I expect dining out. Everything was
excellent! Staff was welcoming, seated right on time.  Heading back next Saturday if
I can get a reservation.

Merry Christmas!"
12/11/2022,BKsna,3.0,Steak was mediocre at best
12/10/2022,Jason,5.0,Another great meal and service as me and 4 of my friends did our annual holiday Mohegan/Jordan's trip.  Cammi and Brian were great as usual and nice to say hello to Dallas.  Hope to see you soon!

12/09/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Tomahawk for 2 special for Friday night date night.. absolutely delicious!! Starter a dozen oysters with the delicious strawberry vignette, so good. Had the tomahawk medium rare- cut like butter with a perfect slight char, topped with the crab bearnaise and asparagus + brussels for sides.. we practically licked the plate. Look at that bone!! Our first time, the service was wonderful all around. Brian was very nice and attentive, we had great conversation. Will return and 10/10 recommend!"
12/08/2022,IrvS,3.0,"It was for a birthday and they didn’t server a cupcake candle to my wife and they knew about the BDay.  Her filet was ordered as medium and came out close to well.  Both the filet and the lamb special was salty.

Our wait staff was very good and responsive."

12/06/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Great dinner with my better half - appetizers (tuna tartare and oysters) were so fresh!  I had the Wagyu steak and my wife had the Schnitzel - both were great!  Topped off with a wonderful bottle of Grgich Hills, it was a meal to remember!  Plus we had amazing and super friendly service!"
12/06/2022,JefferyD,5.0,"Dinner was absolutely amazing - oysters were excellent, Steaks were done perfectly, sides were delicious (but hard to pick as each sounded amazing - thankfully half orders were available), expansive wine selection.  Service was great."
12/04/2022,dbgj,4.0,"The Caesar salad was wet not spinners dry enough. I have had better Caesar dressing. Delmonico steak was tender. Double pork chop delicious.
Smokey Manhattan delicious."
12/03/2022,TonyJ,3.0,"For the first time out of 30 or more visits, the steaks were salty, very salty."

11/30/2022,Melissa,5.0,"My mother and I were celebrating our annual holiday outing.  It was our first time to this restaurant, and everything was amazing from beginning to end.  Food was so good, and the portions were all sharable.  We ordered appetizers, flight 23 and two sides.  All worth it.  Our waitress was great.  I forgot her name, but she had glassed and there every day (as per her).  She made our experience great, and we will be back"
11/29/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The 32 oz porterhouse steak for 2 was delicious and cooked to perfection..

11/27/2022,ktse39,5.0,Entire meal was excellent and service was great. I can't wait to eat there again. Filet and sides were some of the best I've ever had. This was the perfect place to celebrate  a birthday.

Amanda was our server along with Carlos - they were attentive and very helpful with menu choices

They made the entire meal enjoyable
Definitely will return"
11/24/2022,LindaF,3.0,Mediocre turkey dinner. Rushed service. Dinner came out a couple minutes after bread. Would not go there again.
11/24/2022,CntryLady451,3.0,"We decided to enjoy the special Thanksgiving meal being offered. There was a special soup and a turkey entree. The soup was butternut squash and it was delicious. The turkey entree was sliced turkey, red bliss potatoes, green beans, stuffing, and cranberry sauce. We really thought it would be a turkey being sliced and that we would be asked if we wanted white or dark meat. After our amazing soup we waited for a very long time for the entree to arrive. When it did, it was cold. It was more like deli meat than a turkey dinner. The stuffing was bland. We never expected that in the actual steak house. Now we had to wait for them to heat up our meals. There were no special decorations-like it was just another day. Also it was way too dark in there."
11/24/2022,RaviG,5.0,"Amazing. All of it.
From the servers to the food and drinks…the best."
11/23/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Everything was wonderful! The service, the staff, the food, the wine. Excellent!! Very enjoyable evening! Thank you all!"
11/23/2022,JamesB,5.0,I don't often have the opportunity to visit fine dining establishments. This rare opportunity to share an experience with my girlfriend was worth every penny. The service was impeccable and the food was spectacular and well portioned.
11/23/2022,Tommy,5.0,"Service was fantastic. Garlic bread is excellent. Our Filets were cooked exactly the way we like it. The mashed potatoes, mushrooms, dessert Everything this evening was very very very good.  We’re definitely coming back when we’re down that way."
11/21/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We were seated at “Michael Jordan’s” table. The service was wonderful. The food was exceptional as always. Our server was attentive and lovely. Thank you for making my dinner unforgettable!
11/21/2022,AnnemarieS,5.0,Always great food and great service
11/20/2022,DorothyB,5.0,"We are always greeted with friendly's smiles, especially from Dallas, the Manager.  Dallas is such an asset to MJs...he is one of the main reasons we visit Mohegan.  
We ordered MJs delecious Tomahawk rib eye.  Never a dissappointment.  Cooked to perfection and the steak melted in our mouths, as always.
Whenever we visit Mohegan, we enjoy dinner at MJs.
We cannot wait to visit MJs again!"
11/20/2022,LindaP,5.0,Food was excellent. Too much to finish service was outstanding
11/20/2022,IGurl13,3.0,"First visit to MJS, the OpenTable reservation worked greats,  seating was prompt and service was attentive and exceeded our expectations.  The both the speciality drinks and the steaks were ok.  All 3 in our party had the NY Strip and each were cooked as ordered but very fatty and which made it hard enjoy.  The sides were all good.

Would try again if nearby to see if it was better but first impressions make that low priority."
11/20/2022,CherronM,5.0,Everyone in my party thoroughly enjoyed their meals. My sons are avid sports fans as well as my grandson who currently plays basketball at Providence College. It was truly an outstanding evening.
11/19/2022,DebbieL,5.0,The food here is very good always! Never a let down! One of our favorite places to eat!
11/19/2022,Thelly,5.0,Our service Alison was phenomenal. She was attentive and knowledgeable
11/18/2022,MarkP,4.0,"Our experience at Michael Jordan's Steak house @ Mohegan Sun in Connecticut was very very good. Our waitress Danielle was fantastic, she was right there when we needed her, but not too in our faces when we didn't.  The presenter of our meals, whom we didn't get his name, was also excellent. The food was outstanding, we had the mushrooms, the potato trio, the Brussel sprouts, and the Porterhouse steak for two. It was all probably the best food we have ever had. The only minor things that kept our review from being a perfect five starts, ( though it was 4.5 ), was the ambiance. It may be a function of being in the casino, but the noise level was a bit too high for our tastes, and the level of activity by some servers a bit too frantic. All in all, even though it was quite expensive to us, we would return for another special occasion."
11/18/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great meal and service. Would recommend
11/17/2022,MattT,5.0,Great place to enjoy a steak.  Everything was fantastic.

11/13/2022,FredD,4.0,"rib eye was a bit over done , ordered medium was more med well then expected"
11/12/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,rey nice dinner.
11/12/2022,OpenTable Diner,4.0,It was nice but thought it was going to be a bit more upscale honestly.
11/12/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Everything was excellent!
11/12/2022,TamikaS,4.0,Love this restaurant; just today the steak tasted like char from the grill - it was not a good taste. Everything else was good.
11/12/2022,RickR,3.0,"Hostess refused to allow us (party of 4) to sit in a booth, as she was saving it for a friend."
11/11/2022,MariaD,5.0,"My husband and I had the Friday Night Surf & Turf for 2. We enjoyed a Tomahawk Steak with colossal crab meat, grilled asparagus and a bernaise sause. It was simply amazing. Of course the accompanying truffle fries were the best we've ever had! Our dessert was the Baked Alaska which our favorite must have, decadent dessert!"
11/11/2022,MarianneW,5.0,Always a great meal. although pricey. Good for a special occasion. They gave us 2 free glasses of champagne for our anniversary.

11/10/2022,TimA,5.0,"This was the third time we've eaten at MJ's. Food and service is absolutely fantastic, however every time we go, the Cocktail game is weak. Very poorly made old fashioneds and Manhattans. If they didn't use absolutely choice product they'd be borderline....."
11/10/2022,MarybethL,5.0,Our food was outstanding in every way. Service was wonderful. We really appreciated our server Chris who not only was delightful but made some food recommendations (garlic bread and baked Alaska to name a few) that we thoroughly enjoyed. Hope to be back!

By far my favorite!!"
11/07/2022,TommyZ,5.0,Everything was great as always.
11/06/2022,SNG1,5.0,The dining experience here never disappoints.  The hostess went out of her way to put us at a comfortable table as soon as she saw one person in our party had a leg brace on due to a recent injury.  Our server was fantastic and the food is top notch!
11/05/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The hostess gave us the best seats and our waitress was amazing. Enjoyed everything!
11/05/2022,Kelwal67,5.0,Always excellent steaks. Great service. Very accommodating. Always go when we are in the area.

11/04/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Dinner before concert and the rib steak special was absolutely delicious.  The red sauce on the steak and potatoes was outstanding.  The baked Alaska for dessert was the best!!!
11/04/2022,ChristineM,2.0,My husband ordered the $75 rib eye. It was not the quality expected-extremely fatty. We also ordered the lobster bisque and it didn’t taste anything like that? The Mac and cheese was also extremely watery with uncooked noodles. The only good thing was the wedge salad. That was the best part of the dining experience. I’m not sure if this place was just having a bad night but I have a hard time referring anyone to go there.
11/01/2022,StacyP,5.0,"Very good food, service and ambiance"
10/30/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Very nice experience, staff were very friendly and attentive, food was very good and cooked correctly.  Only complaint it was too expensive!  It was good but not that good."
10/29/2022,Steph,5.0,Easily the best restaurant at Mohegan. MJs is a must!
10/28/2022,DouglasR,5.0,"The beet salad and the colossal crab, crab cake were outstanding. The trio of mashed potatoes is innovative and tasty.  Both steaks cooked perfectly waiter was great.  Wine list really nice and expansive."
10/28/2022,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Disappointed in the way they handled my mother and I having dirt in our Caesar salad. Try to play it off as ground pepper and croutons. We have eaten there many times and have ordered the salad and never had a problem. There was clearly dirt in the base of the romaine. I let them give their explanation, but disappointed they couldn’t take responsibility."
10/27/2022,CUsoon,5.0,Venue was very nice.  The food was excellent and the service outstanding.....would have liked to have had a more private space like a booth to enjoy our time there.
10/27/2022,tomh,5.0,great for a special occasion!  terrific steaks and service!

10/23/2022,sara,4.0,"Even though the restaurant was partially empty, we were not seated at our reservation time, which I thought was odd. We were staring at empty tables??  Poor management, but once seated all was good. Great food"
10/22/2022,Betty,3.0,We've had dinner reservations since October 8th for Saturday October 22 at 7 pm.  We arrived at 7:50 pm and was told that we didn't have a table because people weren't either getting up or empty tables needed to be bussed.  We waited until 7:20 pm when my husband complained to the Manager Dallas.  He was a gentleman.  Offered us the first round of drinks on the house.  Brian the waiter was excellent.  The food was excellent too.  We were just disappointed about the table situation especially since we reserved in advance.  Overall a great place.
10/22/2022,Brad,5.0,A great and convenient stop during our stay.  Everything was great- food and service!
10/21/2022,susettec,4.0,I had made a reservation 3 months prior and when I got there they wanted to seat me at the front door where everyone was standing. I said no way and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. I could see empty tables inside which I'm sure were reserved but it wasn't great waiting since 2 of us have bad backs and standing was painful.  I ordered a medium rare steak and it was barely medium but had not time to wait for another. It was still good. Just an honest review.
10/21/2022,sml66,5.0,Our experience at Michael Jordans was outstanding from start to finish. Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly and offered excellent suggestions that added a to the quality of our meal. The porterhouse for 2 was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. I highly recommend this restaurant!
10/21/2022,Christina,5.0,Best steak ever!  Beautiful atmosphere and super friendly staff!
10/20/2022,ZacharyB,2.0,Bad service even worse steak. Not worth the money
10/19/2022,EdwinG,4.0,Crab cakes and Garlic bread are a must! The steaks are always cooked perfect and full of flavor. Service is always excellent!
10/19/2022,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"We’ve eaten here before many times and it was great. However, the food last night was terrible. As a matter of fact, the only good thing was the mashed potatoes and tuna tartare. The manager didn’t bother to visit the table when we mentioned the food quality issues. Definitely won’t be coming back after this experience."
10/19/2022,DavidC,2.0,"Ordered the Prime Delmonico and one sushi tuna steak entree.  Steak was so bad I had to send it back, manager came over and insisted I try the petit filet,got that and it was equally as bad.  rancid flavor, strange texture. At this point I wonder if we were getting beef or buffalo !  Sliced tuna steak was also very rubbery.
Had a greasy food hangover the next morning and I do not even drink.
Called the general manager, ""Dallas"" the next day, left a voice mail, no return call.
Have been to Jordans Mohegan at least 25 times over the years, pre-pandemic, never had an issue.
Will not be going back."
10/19/2022,dpbs2,5.0,"Our dinner was terrific. Very nice Beet Salad and Shrimp Cocktail. My 7 oz. Filet was excellent as was the Creamed Spinach. My girlfriend's Chicken was delicious (her words) as well. Baked Alaska was incredible, better than I expected. 
Chris the Server was very attentive without being overbearing. Have visited this location in the past, and it was our most enjoyable visit yet."
10/18/2022,Foodie1000,3.0,"The steak knives absolutely destroy the steaks. They aren’t sharp at all. I might as well use a butter knife to eat it. The juice in the steak squishes out as I’m trying to cut it. Disappointing for how much I’m paying for a steak. The Kansas City steak was awful. It was charred and had a burnt taste. The filet miñon was beautifully cooked and tasted great but again, the knife did quite a bit of damage to the quality of it. 
We got the roasted heirloom carrots. The first batch came out severely over cooked. They corrected the issue and brought out a fresh dish and they were quite good. The potato trio was good. The double smoked bacon was good, however the fat in the bacon was not caramelized as much as it should have been for being double smoked. 
Our server was Jennine and she was marvelous. She took very good care of us. If I could give five stars for just out server, I would. However, the general manager was clearly frustrated with us for stating what our issues were. He all but yanked my husbands knife away from him when he asked for a replacement knife, which was no better than the first. 
I don’t know if this establishment is just used to a bunch of people coming in and getting drunk off their butts to the point where they do not care about the  quality of their food, or if their chef doesn’t care about the quality of food that is put out, but we are a couple who could easily take the time to make each of these food items well above the standard set by this restaurant. It was a special occasion so we wanted to go out and we were treated as if we did not know what we were talking about by the GM. 

In short, if you go here, bring your own steak knife, and don’t complain if something is not right."
10/17/2022,CherylT,5.0,Best steak I ever ate!  Allowed us to split entrees and sides amongst those in our party.  Staff was very helpful and knowledgeable.  Very pleasant evening.
10/17/2022,KaylaM,5.0,"My husband and I came for dinner during our honeymoon. We were delighted by our experience! Our waiter, Bryan, was very knowledgeable on the menu and and helped us make the right choice on what to order."
10/16/2022,Kimd,5.0,Been here a few times and wouldn’t hesitate to return
10/16/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Beautiful 👌😍😍😍
10/15/2022,KevinK,5.0,"Amazing service and food! I highly recommend the MJ steakhouse. Our server Jen was wonderful and elevated our experience. She had great recommendations and we ended up getting the Caesar Salad to share, Oysters, Grilled Octopus and Tomahawk to share. We finished the night with a baked Alaska which is rare to see in a menu."
10/15/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We enjoyed everything at Michael Jordan's. We were very happy with our meals. Can't wait to return! :)
10/15/2022,PeterC,4.0,This is probably the best steakhouse I’ve ever eaten at. The service was the most friendliest! They were at our every request. The only complaint I have is my steak was the wagyu strip and it was not a good piece of meat. It was 85$ and wasn’t impressed. My wife got the 10oz filet for 58$ and the filet was 100x better. Other than that food was impeccable. Sides were outstanding and very filling. Definitely recommend!!!
10/15/2022,Excellent,5.0,I had a great experience at Michael Jordan’s Steak House @ Mohegan Sun casino.  This was my first time there and I’ll definitely go back.  My wife and I shared a beautifully prepared tomahawk steak for 2.  The temperature was perfect and the presentation was spot-on.  The wait staff was excellent - very informative (they knew their meat) and were very attentive.  I can’t say enough good things about this quality establishment.
10/14/2022,StacyA,5.0,"Great food, great service. Reservations recommended!"
10/14/2022,Paull,5.0,"Service was excellent 
Food was amazing"
10/14/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,It was very special!
10/14/2022,CWPB,5.0,Dinner was absolutely delicious! Had the garlic bread for an appetizer that was out of this world. Tipped off with a delicious slice of key lime pie!
10/11/2022,MichelleJ,5.0,"The service and the food was top notch.  We made a reservation and were seated right on time.  Steaks cooked to perfection.  Try the garlic bread, it's amazing."
10/10/2022,ZOROVT1,5.0,Would return to Mohegan Sun just to have dinner at this steakhouse.
10/10/2022,Kathleen,4.0,"MJ’s has always been one of my favorite places to eat, however I must say I do not like the menu changes; the menu was great and didn’t need fixing. It is way overpriced for what you are served, a 7 ounce filet is $48 (and if it was 7 ounces I would be surprised).  I was disappointed and probably will choose another spot to dine."
10/10/2022,ChuckA,5.0,It was my wife’s birthday.  I love Michael Jordan’s for a well prepared meal.
10/10/2022,HappyGuest,4.0,Simone made our experience wonderful! She was attentive and friendly and we enjoyed her service. The food was great and we would come back for sure!
10/10/2022,Brittany,5.0,"Outstanding dinner for our anniversary! Our waiter was phenomenal and gave us some really helpful suggestions. Our entire meal was outstanding: we started with the garlic bread, and then had a porterhouse for two, broccolini, and mashed potato trio for our entree. 10/10 recommend!"
10/09/2022,ShaylaD,5.0,"Michael Jordan's Steak House at Mohegan Sun is always a nice experience. Service is wonderful and food is delicious. It's very expensive but a great place for a special night out. Our favorites were the crab cake, filet mignon, roasted mushrooms and salmon."
10/09/2022,depo,5.0,"The food although pricey, was excellent.  The service was attentive and top notch."
10/09/2022,NYFoodie,4.0,"MJS is awesome. Ambience is wonderful, especially in a cozy booth. Wine list is extensive. Staff is embracing, and personable especially the manager.  Unfortunately I chose the “Steak Frites” entree. 100% Sirloin never tastes this chewy, and unflavored. The garlic bread appetizer, and baked alaska dessert are MJ staples, but their steak definitely is not. Will go back. Maybe I expect too much for a $42 steak?"
10/09/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Amazing experience! Best customer service we’ve had in awhile. Food was cooked to perfection and atmosphere was relaxing. We will definitely be back again.

10/08/2022,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"I feel so bad , but the lobster was so over cooked I had to spit it out . The steak tasted really bad like an unclean grill top . I will not spread bad reviews of this place but I would check your repeat customers."

10/02/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Never a disappointment when we dine here! Everything from your drink to your dessert will be delicious! I recommend the steak flights for those looking to try different types of steaks, but definitely have someone to share with! All sides are shareable sizes and delicious as well. Our favorites are the creamed spinach and mashed potato trio. The blue cheese garlic bread and thick cut bacon are a must for appetizers!"
10/02/2022,JoeM,5.0,"Wait staff was amazing, food was great.  Love this place as always it delivers.  

Forgot the waiter’s name but he was great too!"
10/01/2022,DennisE,5.0,Terrific service and food. Family had a great time! Simone and Anthony were great and very attentive. We will be going back!
10/01/2022,stacib,5.0,Everything was amazing. Celebrated my mothers birthday —they not only gave a dessert but also a birthday card signed by the entire FOH.  Very impressed
10/01/2022,DonaldP,5.0,"Extraordinary experience. Food, atmosphere, service. Staff very attentive. Could use some brighter candles."
10/01/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Always delicious.   Crab cake is amazing
09/30/2022,Anonymous,5.0,The food was outstanding. You definitely get what you pay for. I had the 10 oz filet as my main course and it was the best steak I’ve ever had.
09/30/2022,Brandon,5.0,"My wife and I had our first kid-free night in 8 months! I wanted to try the steak here and it didn't disappoint. Everything was lovely, from the hostesses to the wait staff to the cooks. We will definitely be back."
09/30/2022,TomS,5.0,Overall experience was outstanding. This was our first time visiting and will definitely return. Ordered Tuna steak and salmon both dishes were amazing. Only thing to note is if you prefer not to have the skin on your salmon be sure to request it when ordering.
09/30/2022,Tejo5,3.0,"Overrated. Birthday getaway, had requested special table - and were sat in the middle, very dark, many other tables had cake/desert brought to table for their special ceremonies and despite a Hostess extending well wishes and leaving B-Day card on table, no acknowledgement by server. 

Expected better experience. May not return."
09/30/2022,RichS,4.0,"Although the steak was good, it seemed it was precooked because from the time we arrived to the restaurant , we were already serviced and finished eating in about 30 mins.  We felt rushed. We spent about $200 for the Surf & Turf Tomahawk Special that was tasty. Not a cheap meal and not the best experience we were hoping for."
09/29/2022,CaraH,5.0,Our waitress was extremely kind and helpful. I also had shared in the reservation that someone in the party was celebrating the birthday and they were treated to birthday wishes as well as a dessert. Overall it was fabulous and the food was delicious!! That garlic bread topped them all!!
09/29/2022,dpsct,3.0,"The $70 45-day dry aged Del Monaco steak was tough and unflavorful. The service was exceptional as usual and of course they took the steak off the bill. They did everything that they could do to make it right, but obviously the state that they was just not up to the usual standard for Michael Jordan’s. I would go back again.

The baked potato and asparagus were excellent"
09/28/2022,RadleyN,5.0,Great as always. They have changed their menu. they got rid of some favorites and the new items were not a plus. They staff was fantastic as always. Bring back the old favorites please.
09/28/2022,MicheleB,5.0,Gave us a card and champagne for our anniversary! Nice touch!
09/26/2022,EMWA,3.0,"I called the general manager of Michael Jordan’s at Mohegan Sun three times and he never called me back. I was charged $80 for four crab cakes and we had one crab cake each. The wait staff was excellent! I also filed a claim with the credit card company.
Thank you."
09/26/2022,thomasl,3.0,The steak wasn't really that good. One was under cooked. The presentation was not good at all.
09/26/2022,DeborahF,5.0,Excellent meal. Pleasantly surprised that good of food and service inside a casino existed!
09/25/2022,Maxx,1.0,"We ordered a filet and a caesar salad and a delmonico steak. When the food came, the butter would not melt on the filet (been standing too long), the caesar salad was not romaine and had some bottled dressing poured on it, and there was so much fat on the delmonico it was inedible.  Never again"
09/25/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Good was delicious, service was outstanding. Always choose MJ’s Steakhouse when we come to Mohegan!"
09/25/2022,JamesC,4.0,"Tables very close to each other plus the noise level was super high due to a full house, this place not for any special occasion or for the ambience.  I could not even hear our waitress talk, I had to repeat the specials.    I would avoid weekends, week days maybe better.  Food was excellent"
09/25/2022,HowardW,3.0,"Always liked MJ’s in the past. This time, 3 of the 4 steaks just weren’t good. Two Delmonicos had way too much fat. I had the Kansas City bone in, and it was very tough. That said, my wife had the NY Strip and loved it. Garlic bread (best thing there) and the sides were all outstanding. Service is top notch.  My recommendation is, stay with either the NY Strip or the filet mignon."
09/24/2022,CarmineM,5.0,Birthday dinner was fabulous
09/24/2022,NancyB,5.0,Great place to celebrate our Anniversary- great server and excellent food.  Steak was cooked perfectly and the garlic bread is amazing.  Prices are similar to any high end steak house
09/24/2022,HelenF,5.0,Birthday dinner.  Service was exceptional. Food was exceptional. Ambiance exceptional. Would go back in a heartbeat. Highly recommend.
09/24/2022,HeatherP,2.0,"The food was not that good for a high end restaurant. The lobster was over cooked, octopus had no flavor, and the meatballs were over cooked as well"
09/23/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Our server and the manager were amazing last night!
09/23/2022,sara,5.0,"Wonderful dinner. , service great till end. Then they sorta forgot about us , otherwise great"
09/23/2022,DallasP,5.0,Amazing! The food was exceptional and our servers were the absolute best.
09/22/2022,Robss,5.0,Another perfect meal. Exceptional service from Nicki and her assistant Ryan (had him several times and he is so fun and personable). Host came over to check on me which is so appreciated. My favorite restaurant in all casinos because food and service can’t be beat.
09/20/2022,Rubin,2.0,"Overpriced!  For example..........$70.00 for two drinks of Blanton's Bourbon....A bottle cost less than that.

Seated near an open door into which people came to talk to others.  Had to ask waiter to close the door.  Even then it happened again.

I will never go back"
09/20/2022,RonD,5.0,"We had a very good dining experience, the waitress’s and support staff, we’re exceptional!!!"
09/19/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Fantastic food and great experience!!
09/18/2022,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"It was 6:30pm, They said there was no table available till around 8pm … I went onto open table and there was a table available for 6:45pm … went back in with the reservation and they took us in immediately 🤣🤣 so take that however you want to 

Food came out quick , food was good - I think it depends on your own past experiences with steak houses to compare. 

Price point is a little high for the experience but it’s at Mohegan sun , so anything in that place you may expect to pay slightly more money"
09/18/2022,LaVoz,1.0,Michael Jordan’s is  nothing but hype. The food was comparable to Applebees or TGI Friday’s on a bad night. Jordan’s crush cocktail was weak. Complimentary bread and whipped butter/black salt was the best dish there. Save your money and go to TAO instead.
09/18/2022,AjaD,5.0,"All around absolutely amazing!! From the service, to the food, A+. We got the porterhouse for 2 and it melts in your mouth. The service was also very attentive and kind. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
09/17/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Everything was great and would come again!
09/17/2022,DominickP,5.0,Everything was excellent except but I have one complaint.  The scallops were pathetically small and thin.  Please take them off the menu if you plan on serving the same in the future.
09/17/2022,SalB,5.0,"The entire experience was fabulous quality of the food, attentive staff can’t say enough good things. As good or better than most NYC steak houses"
09/17/2022,AlanS,5.0,"The best place to eat at Mohegan I love it here, the food is always amazing from the

 garlic bread with the blue cheese fondue to the steaks it's always good. We enjoy 

each and every time we go to Mohegan Sun.   We made a special request for our 

youngest's sons Birthday and they happily obliged    Its family friendly, and the kids 

enjoy it just as much as we do.   Love it and we shall see you all next time."
09/17/2022,EdwardM,5.0,Excellent experience! First class service and excellent food!
09/17/2022,IGonzalez,5.0,"Great service,  great food... a little dark  to see menus.  We made reservations for our anniversary and to celebrate my husband's birthday did not disappoint."
09/17/2022,Krystal,2.0,We were very excited to celebrate our 10 yr wedding anniversary. Unfortunately we had to wait a long time for our food to come. I ordered my steak medium rare plus and it came out completely raw. I would have even been ok if it was medium rare but it was totally raw and cold on the inside. By the time the server checked on us to see if everything was alright my husband had already finished eating. We didnt feel like waiting another 45 min for my steak to be recooked so I ended up leaving without anything to eat. We were so excited for our first experience here and were so incredibly disappointed. Not sure if we would give it another try.
09/17/2022,Rick,5.0,Brian and Ryan were amazing servers!  Quality of the meat and sides were as good as it gets.
09/17/2022,TatumLS,5.0,Love Michael Jordan’s

09/15/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Wonderful dinner!!!
09/15/2022,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Sorry to say my steak was chewy and I was sick all night afterwards
09/11/2022,Arlibarli,2.0,I was quite disappointed tonight. Usually the steaks are delicious. We shared the porterhouse and it was veiny and no taste. Service was off too
09/11/2022,None,4.0,Wygu steak wasn’t real wygu you can taste the difference. Disappointing to say the least.
09/11/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Fantastic steak!
09/10/2022,Rocky,5.0,"What can I say, just another great night at MJs . Dallas and his staff are second to none and are always fast and accurate. This time we had a waiter that we haven't had before, I think his name was Tusa. very polite and on the the ball taking our order and getting our cocktails. The food was excellent, Had the 10oz filet and it was cooked perfectly. but before the we had the tomato soup which I think everyone should try and the Baked Alaska is the perfect ending.  coffee and cappuccino were also good."
09/10/2022,rosemariem,5.0,Thanks for a Fabulous Dinner & my favorite table as always!! Dallas your always accommodating us & Kate was a lovely hostess!! Looking forward to seeing you guys soon 🔜 Again!! 🥰Rosemarie & MikeMusone from Narragansett RI
09/10/2022,Cathy,5.0,It was a wonderful meal. From the appetizers to the main course. Tomahawk steak was outrageous.
09/10/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The staff was amazing and very knowledgable.  I was impressed with the quality of the food and the keylime pie was the best I’ve ever had in a restaurant.  I came back the next night and had another piece.  I also want to commend Dallas for how he managed to move our reservations so everyone would arrive at the same time and the care he took to make sure we were seated as close together as possible. The food was delicious!  I highly recommend this dining experience. Thanks Janine
09/09/2022,ChrisS,5.0,Food was excellent and experience was first class.
09/07/2022,Steaklover55,5.0,"Delicious food and friendly, attentive staff. Highly recommend!"
09/07/2022,FrankP,5.0,Expected more from entrees. Had tuna tartar app and Cesar’s salad both wonderful. Scallops were ok at best and gnocchi was awful . Desert was average carrot cake looked and tasted like it just came out of a box. Wife’s key lime pie was good.
09/06/2022,BostonCousin,5.0,It never disappoints!! Delicious food and wonderful service.
09/06/2022,MaryS,5.0,"We eat here every time we stay at Mohegan Sun. 
Cannot rave enough about Michael Jordan’s. 
Fabulous, fabulous food. 
Top notch service and staff. 
For the best dining experience this is the place go to."
09/05/2022,JT524,4.0,"Food is great, service was excellent! Only complain is the manager, or the person who thought he was a big deal. He walked around like he was better than everyone, only approached tables if someone ordered a flight/something off of the steaksmanship series. After spending the evening before at Ballo (also at Mohegan Sun), the manager came out and greeted EVERY table to make sure that we were all enjoying our experience. Didn’t matter how much money you were spending; it was about each persons overall dining experience. This really stood out to me (good for ballo, not so great for MJ’s). However, our wait staff was PHENOMENAL and made our experience a really great one, even if the manager didn’t quite care. Great food and would recommend, but we will most likely stick to Ballo when going to the casino"
09/05/2022,PhillyMom,5.0,"We had a lovely evening at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse. It is a quiet tranquil environment and service is gracious and attentive. A few dishes, like the tuna tartare and the macaroni and cheese were fine but not great. The steaks and creamed spinach was terrific. We will happily return when we are in town."
09/05/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Celebrated our anniversary. Everything was great. Simone was exceptional.
09/05/2022,ELIZABETHS,5.0,Food and service always excellent.  Staff very attentive.
09/05/2022,Mike,2.0,"New menu has dropped once offered steak add ons. 

New menu offers less than a typical steakhouse restaurant menu.

New menu has dropped specials."
09/05/2022,MichaelB,5.0,Only “complaint” is that it was a ton of food and couldn’t stop eating until we were absolutely stuffed.
09/04/2022,LindaR,4.0,"Very friendly,  we were greeted by every staff member saw.   Very impressive !"
09/04/2022,JorgeG,2.0,The food was not worth the price. You're paying for the name only.
09/04/2022,GisselaC,5.0,Food and service were exceptional!
09/04/2022,MichaelH,5.0,Great food and outstanding service.looking forward to our next visit.
09/04/2022,ShondreaH,5.0,It was my birthday and they made the night very special for me!! The food was absolutely delicious and I had an amazing server who took great care of me. I enjoyed the beautiful environment and will definitely be back again on my next visit to Mohegan Sun.
09/03/2022,GaryL,5.0,As usual a great overall experience
09/03/2022,OpenTable Diner,1.0,Over priced. Uneducated staff when it comes to wine. Lack of experience at the front. Lip stains on my wine glass.. should I keep going?
09/03/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"One of the best restaurants I’ve been to, service was outstanding, everyone made you feel very welcome, everyone was very attentive, food was outstanding, will definitely be back again"
09/03/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"From the moment we walked in the door, until we left, our entire experience was top notch! The hostesses at the front door were very pleasant and personable! Our server, Brian was very professional and friendly. He offered recommendations that we decided to order, one being the crab cake as well as the Delmonico! He really made our experience and we could tell he truly loves what he does!"
09/03/2022,AnthonyC,4.0,"Wonderful service and ambiance, but my wagyu steak was over cooked and lobster was really dry. Mac & cheese was incredible along with garlic bread and mashed potatoes. My wife loved her desert as well."
09/03/2022,Brian,4.0,"A nice, solid steakhouse. Nice wine options. Booths are excellent. Friendly staff."
09/02/2022,JohnG,5.0,"Everything was tremendous including food, service etc. We were celebrating a anniversary and the wait staff decided to serve complimentary champagne. We had ordered ginger ale and a seltzer with cran and orange juice. That should have been a hint. We don’t drink. One of us in recovery and the other is supportive of that endeavor. We are not trying to hammer Jordan’s but wish to remind other servers to be aware of this type of circumstance."
09/02/2022,LarissaM,4.0,"I want to start off by saying that this restaurant is typically one we frequent for special occasions; birthdays, anniversaries, etc. My husband and I enjoy it. The food is typically delicious, service is great, and we usually don’t have any complaints. 

We have visited twice this year alone, yesterday for our anniversary and back in May for my birthday. Both times one of our steaks was cooked incorrectly. Previous to this year, we visited last year for my husband’s birthday and his steak was cooked incorrectly. This would be 3x in a row now that this has happened. We enjoy our steaks cooked medium-well to well done and I know that isn’t what’s recommended by steak connoisseurs or desired by chefs, but irregardless as the consumer we have a right to ask for our steaks to be made how we like. When I received my steak last night, it was medium-rare and when I told the waiter he was very polite and took the steak back. When I received it a second time, the steak was burned so badly it was charred. The manager noticed pretty quickly and came over to let me know he would take the steak off of the bill. He asked me if I would like a new one and I declined as we were headed to a concert. The waiter brought us some complimentary sides and a dessert to make up for our experience which I appreciated very much. I just feel having to send a steak back on 3 different occasions is unacceptable at the level of fine dining this restaurant is expected to provide."
09/01/2022,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Went out here on a date with my fiancée. The food was amazing and the wait staff were truly wonderful. The food however took probably close to 45 minutes to get out. Additionally, it was absolutely freezing in there, to point where it was a little over the top."
08/31/2022,Michaelw,5.0,MJ food is amazing
08/31/2022,ThereseC,5.0,WONDERFUL!  Attention to details
08/30/2022,MiguelG,5.0,This was my first time and not my last the food is amazing and I recommend the garlic bread with the blue cheese fondue 🫕
08/30/2022,DanL,5.0,"Started with a Manhattan with Saranac rye.  Drink was strong, but could have used a touch more vermouth vs rye.  Our server Robert recommended the delicious garlic bread with blue cheese fondue for an appetizer which was delicious.  My wife and I selected the porterhouse for two medium rare and it was cooked perfectly and we liked the presentation with the bone standing vertically.  Sides were the trio of mashed potatoes and broccolini.  Broccolini was excellent and seasoned nicely with a nice bit of heat from some crushed red pepper.  Two out of three mashed potatoes were excellent, the plain and the spring onion.  The bacon gorda was tasty, but too salty.  Overall an excellent an memorable meal and we will return!"
08/29/2022,Anniversary,5.0,"Staff was fantastic. We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door. Waitress was attentive to our needs from the mi Ute we sat down. Food as usual was great. MJ’s is our go to for special occasions. 

Thank you"
08/29/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,4 year anniversary diner. The music they had on was great. The place is beautiful. They had some options for my food allergies. The staff was very sweet
08/28/2022,ljg61,5.0,Never a bad meal at MJ's . Celebrated friend's anniversary. Everyone came over and acknowledged it. My Delmonico steak was cooked to perfection!!. The only place we go when staying at Mohegan Sun.
08/28/2022,Nettie,2.0,For a steak house not the best.  Steakhouse prices & seems quality of food is not a priority.  Overcrowded to the max & packed like sardines .
08/27/2022,TheresaB,5.0,It was very dark inside for a sports type of restaurant. The food was great but all alacart and expensive. The service was great I guess that’s what you pay for.
08/27/2022,Tommyboy,5.0,Food was awesome! Wallet hurts but that comes with the territory. Lol great time
08/27/2022,JeanC,5.0,The atmosphere was dreamy and the food… I felt like I had gone to heaven. I can’t wait to go back in a month or two.
08/26/2022,Christian,5.0,"This was our fourth or fifth time to MJ’s  and like usual, Everything was excellent! We will be back again!"
08/26/2022,AnnaF,5.0,"Always an outstanding meal and top notch service. Our server, Amanda was awesome !!"
08/26/2022,SarahR,3.0,"Okay first thing you should know is the food is top notch. Everything cooked wonderfully and presented beautifully. Our server was nice and attentive. However while celebrating his birthday my brother ended up with an entire cup of steak sauce and remants of his bone in steak dumped onto his shirt when the woman clearing out table dropped the plates in his lap. She of course apologized and offered him 4 Shout wipes as compensation. She did not tell the server, we did and nothing was offered to him. At the very least dry cleaning could have been offered. 
I expect more from a supposed upscale establishment and honestly don’t think I’ll go back after seeing the disregard they had for their mistake. Perhaps you think that’s extreme but an entire ruined outfit on top of a sizable bill was not how he planned to spend his birthday."
08/26/2022,JACKH,5.0,Great service with exquisite food. Everyone was pleasant. Best anniversary dinner to date. Can’t wait to go back
08/25/2022,Ashleigh,5.0,Nicki was an outstanding hostess. She made every effort to make my family and I have an enjoyable dinner. She frequently checked on us and filled our glass with water. My fiancé loved his salmon and my son enjoyed his fries with grilled chicken and egg (as requested). The room was nicely lit and the noise level was moderate. We would definitely recommend this restaurant and will return soon. Thank you!
08/25/2022,Mario,4.0,"food was well prepared, and the tuna was excellent"
08/25/2022,TonyB,5.0,Was an amazing ambiance for that can’t be duplicated and great service even a bilingual waiter that assisted with the menu for my date
08/25/2022,MikkiStixx,4.0,"Steak, the filet mignon was excellent! Couple of things... we were a well dressed couple celebrating a birthday and it was a later weeknight evening. We were going to be placed at a bs table on top of other people, when there was a few romantic booths open. We of course asked to be moved. Why would you do that? Our servers were very good and the free desert for the bday was a nice touch. All in all a pleasurable experience."
08/24/2022,MaryannF,5.0,"Michael Jordan's never disappoints.....food is always fabulous!!! Steaks cooked to perfection, sides always delicious!!!

08/23/2022,Phil,5.0,"Always a good time at Jordon's.  Nice selection of wines by the glass.  Great Cappicino.  Quality of food is excellent and nice size portions.  We usally sit at the bar, but choose a table which worked out fine,

Very enjoyable"
08/23/2022,Elizalee,4.0,"This place was WONDERFUL! We had the steak platter (I cant remember what its called!) Which had the New York strip, the Filet, smoked sausage, and another steak! It was all perfectly cooked, nicely charred and tasted like heaven. We also had the Mashed potato trio (the bacon one is where its at!) And their homemade steaksauce is something I highly recommend. We had mentioned that it was my birthday and they were quick to celebrate me and make me feel completely at home. All in all, the food was absolutely delicous, the atmosphere, while a bit noisy, was welcoming and lovely, and the drinks were delicious- if a bit overpriced for what you get. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a fancy date night!"
08/22/2022,JulietteZ,4.0,"This restaurant provided excellent cuisine with great ambiance. The service was a bit slow and the steaks were mixed up upon arrival - too late to change it or send it back. Nonetheless, it was a good dining experience and I would recommend it!"

08/21/2022,GerardB,4.0,"Our server, Amanda was outstanding! Very attentive and personable. Food was delicious as always and portions were enough to make two meals."
08/21/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We went for my mothers birthday, she was given a card signed by all employees at the start of our dinner and ended with a slice of cake with a candle at the end, it was so sweet and i really loved that they went above and beyond for us. The food was top notch as well as the service. This will def be a staple in our future visits to Mohegan casino! Thank you MJ steak house for making moms birthday a little more special!"
08/21/2022,MsMi,5.0,"The hostess Samantha and Nori was very kind and friendly. Our server, Allison was very sweet, attentive, informative and friendly. We love all our dishes especially the specials! Thank you for your hospitality, Allison. We definitely be back."
08/21/2022,MDPT,4.0,"Great service! Note that they have a generous amount of appetizer (smoked bacon), make sure you have room for the entree! They have a good selection of local oysters. The mashed potato trio side is a must-try with your steak, never enjoyed mashed potatoes before until now. As the steak is superb, the dessert needs a little tweak; creme brulee is good, but the baked Alaska? (forgot the actual name), not sure how to make of it. It's ice cream floating in a sea of syrup with nuts, too overwhelming. Overall, good food and good service!"
08/21/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Excellent and attentive waitstaff, food and martinis were excellent, a definite must!"
08/20/2022,LoveLongIsland,2.0,"Wanted to like it, they have a captive audience if you are staying in the hotel!! Mohegan is great, should have a better steakhouse sad to say!
Our server  and food runners were very friendly and attentive, made sub par food as good experience as possible."
08/20/2022,ScottB,4.0,"Two critiques,

When we arrived for our reservation we still had to wait outside the restaurant for a table to be available. I would think with a reservation they would have one available. 

Secondly, ordered a medium rare steak, half was rare, half was medium rare. For 75 dollar steak it should be cooked as ordered."
08/20/2022,MaureenY,5.0,Excellent food and service . Very pricey though. Great for special occasions
08/20/2022,NicoleJ,5.0,"Decided to go to the casino for our anniversary and made a reservation at Michael Jordan’s for dinner and we were so glad we did! From the moment we walked in everyone was very friendly and professional.  The food was amazing, steaks were cooked perfectly, I had the filet and my husband had the Kansas City and we had the mashed potato trio which was super yummy! As an added touch they even gave us an Anniversary card signed by all the staff, and complimentary champagne which was so nice.  We had a great meal and a great experience."
08/20/2022,RLT1,4.0,"This was our second visit to MJ over the past two months.  Our last visit was much better than the first.  My wife, son and I went there for Father's Day and I ordered the Delmonico steak (very expensive!) and my son ordered lamb chops.  Both were overcooked and tasteless.  I sent y steak back and ordered the New York strip.  That steak was also overcooked!!   My wife and I have eaten at MJ many times and alway enjoyed well prepared food.  I concluded that the kitchen must have been  overwhelmed and put an inexperienced cook on the grill that day.    Our most recent visit was much better, but I  decided avoid the steak and ordered the pork chop instead.  It was delicious!!!"
08/20/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,It was for my birthday and my server was amazing. Was very knowledgeable and kind.
08/20/2022,louied13,5.0,Steaksmanship sampler was amazing - well worth it for a group!
08/20/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,It was amazing from start to finish!! Our waiter helped us pick our wine base on what we like!! Even though they didn’t have the surf and turf available she helped us with our dinner choice. Will definitely be back!’ Oh yeah the octopus was banging!!
08/19/2022,Robert,5.0,Outstanding overall!! Food was delicious! Service was top notch!! Tate took care of everything we needed!!
08/19/2022,Patrick,4.0,"A little too much salt on the steaks, pricing is a little much for some options, not the place for me"
08/18/2022,R4ch3l,5.0,Our servers were incredible and my fiancé’s steak was the best he’d ever had.
08/18/2022,EdGen,5.0,Wonderful Anniversary dinner at MJ’s.  Food is terrific and excellent service by Jen and Jorge!  Well done!

08/15/2022,ScottB,5.0,"Fabulous ......everything wad great.
Had lamb chops they were done to perfection."
08/15/2022,wb620,5.0,"We look forward to visiting MJ’s when we go to Mohegan Sun.  The food is consistently top-notch, particularly the beef entrees.  The prices reflect the quality, but worth the splurge."
08/15/2022,StephanieJ,2.0,"Too loud. Drink was too sour. Steak was over cooked & charred. I felt like it was a Tri-Fecta of unfortunate events :( Very hesitant to try again. 

** Manager did comp the steak and was very nice. However, just plain upsetting series of things; my friends rave about this place."
08/14/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Samoane was wonder. Food was excellent. Totally enjoyed the experience.
08/14/2022,MariyaV,5.0,A great place to eat especially if you are celebrating a special occasion! Service was wonderful definitely worth the money
08/14/2022,TommyZ,5.0,"Food excellent 
Service excellent
Staff excellent"
08/14/2022,SandraF,5.0,Had reservations and was able to be seated early which was nice.  Waiter was very attentive but not overkill.  Had the octopus and Caesar salad which were both very yummy.  Porterhouse steak for two with the truffle parm and mushrooms which was exceptional.  Had a side of scallops which were a bit over cooked. Bread was great with their special butter. Overall would recommend. A bit loud but you are next to the casino she to be expected.
08/12/2022,DavidS,5.0,As always great food served in an excellent environment with good staff. No complaints and would definitely recommend.
08/12/2022,MOllyC,2.0,Restaurant was nice. Took forever for food order. We finished appetizer before drinks came. Lobster tasted and smelt like ammonia.
08/12/2022,Stephaniem,3.0,Decent food. Music does not fit the intended ambiance. Waiters need to stop coming every 5 min and leave people alone to talk.
08/11/2022,Michael,4.0,Delmonico Dry Aged was the best!!!  I would eat at the bar on a return trip.
08/11/2022,RobO,5.0,"Thank you for a wonderful 20th anniversary!
We had a superb meals, and incredible desserts."
08/11/2022,AmberP,5.0,I’ll be dreaming about the spicy peach and tequila drink for the rest of my life. Also our server Robert was attentive and knowledgeable.
08/11/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Outstanding experience overall. Big plus that the menu was so accommodating to a vegetarian diet.
08/10/2022,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Should stick to steak.  We ordered tuna which was too fishy and octopus that was under cooked.   Waitress was Amazinf and covered her bases.
08/09/2022,Amanda,5.0,"Absolutely excellent overall, as always. The hostess was friendly and engaging, the food was delicious, the ambiance was wonderful for the occasion and our waiter was knowledgeable, attentive, kind, friendly and just fantastic. Couldn’t have asked for a better experience."
08/07/2022,PatriciaK,5.0,Fabulous food and cocktails. Staff is super friendly especially Simone our server. She showed us MJs rings and engraved steak knife.  I hope she is there when we go back
08/07/2022,MarkR,4.0,The steak and lamb chops was very very salty. Waitress was very friendly.
08/06/2022,CynthiaT,3.0,"We have been going to Michael Jordan's since it opened.  The food this year has been a challenge.  Not sure if they have a new chef, but the changes make dinner not as enjoyable."
08/06/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Everything was delicious! Will definitely be back.
08/06/2022,JayG,3.0,Servers had attitudes  would not go back- - - - - -
08/06/2022,WayneW,3.0,"Have been at MJ’s before. My wife’s birthday was the occasion. We were seated somewhat near the bar and not at a table or booth and in an area that was so noisy we couldn’t talk without a lot of “ what did you say” being exchanged . We asked about the open tables we viewed but we’re told they were all taken. 
I would have thought that knowing it was a birthday dinner a much better table location would have been offered .
The food and service were all very good but next time if the seating location for a special occasion dinner is as what we got on August 5th I will leave."
08/06/2022,MollyS,5.0,I came here for my birthday and they were so generous and the food was amazing!!
08/05/2022,geoffreym,5.0,"We came in for our last dinner 
Jen and Taylor gave excellent service 
The food was great overall except:
Steak was very over salted!"
08/05/2022,MikeK,5.0,Outstanding food and service although somewhat pricey!
08/05/2022,mspontiac,5.0,Our steaks were simply delicious.  Did not enjoy the ceasar salad too much - seemed very salty.
08/05/2022,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"The food experience was not as valued as they  make you believe. 
Very over priced and not much on the menu. Good if you just want a steak. Hope you don’t want a side. Average food  with “fine”dining prices."
08/05/2022,WayneA,3.0,Even with a reservation we had to stand in a line for 20 minutes before being seated. Once seated we were passed over for other tables with more customers. We made the early reservation because we had a show to attend at 7. We never received our main meal till 6:20. Food was good but forced to rush in order to make show. No time to consider desert or coffee. We believe that not enough main servers and more than enough algae eaters. We were very disappointed with the experience for the costs.
08/03/2022,RobG,5.0,First visit. Food was great. Waiter was excellent .
08/03/2022,Bella,5.0,Excellent as always! My family LOVES coming here. The food is exceptional. Michael Jordon’s Steakhouse is truly a gem!!! FABULOUS !!!!
08/02/2022,NikaB,5.0,"We had a wonderful dinner at MJ’s steak house. The food was super delicious and flavorful and the portion sizes were way more than expected, we definitely left full! We would absolutely go back! Additionally, our server was very kind and attentive!"
07/30/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Our server, Bryon, was fantastic! We had a wonderful dinner in a quiet booth, the steak (filet) was fantastic, cooked perfectly, the potatoes were delicious and the salad was great (Caesar). Highly recommended if you’re in Mohegan Sun."
07/30/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great food!
07/30/2022,Aimalee,5.0,"Great dinner spot at Mohegan Sun! Started with the appetizer crab cake on the waiter’s recommendation. Didn’t disappoint! The crab cake was all crab, no filler. Amazing!"
07/29/2022,MichelleD,4.0,Toooooo salty! My prime sirloin was unfortunately tough.  I know it’s not a higher end choice but it should have been more tender.  I get prime sirloin and it is excellent.  Disappointed in quality.  But the absolute worst thing is overseasoning of foods!   My mouth was burning from salt.
07/29/2022,DavidR,5.0,Food was prepared just right. And they gave each of us a free glass of Champagne for our Anniversary.
07/29/2022,MarioR,3.0,Our waiter didn’t offer the house bread that’s come with the service instead he suggested the garlic bread for 13 my stripper bass was salty the tomahawk steak for two didn’t looked like it was all there
07/28/2022,JosephD,5.0,Had the steak platter with all the different cuts cooked to perfection
07/28/2022,Mario,5.0,food and service were excellent. I would recommend for all special occasions.
07/24/2022,AnthonyC,5.0,"EXCELLENT! We were there for Valentines day, and this time was our one year Anniversary to the day! Our waiter was more than perfect, great attitude, perfect service, he is a reason I would come back and request him again! Food was amazing as always, this time we finally got to have dessert and we could not believe how good it was! We will always go there for special occasions!"
07/24/2022,SoxFan,5.0,Michael Jordan's was a great experience at Mohegan Sun!  The Wait staff was outstanding!  They made great recommendations that were spot on with what we were looking for!  The MVP Steakmanship Series was a homerun which left us unable to order desert!
07/24/2022,JeffC,5.0,"The restaurant was very crowded, yet that did not impact our service one bit. Our server was outstanding. The food was great and we'll definitely be back next time we are at Mohegan Sun."
07/23/2022,MollyM,5.0,"The best food ever, I was so impressed. The drinks, ambiance and waiter were all lovely. Want to come back already."
07/23/2022,JoeD,5.0,"Exceptional meal as always. My wife and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary and were greeted with a card from the staff as well as complimentary champagne. MJ’s pays exceptional attention to the little things to make the overall experience so enjoyable. Matusalem was our waiter and paid very close attention to us to ensure we were having a great meal. All of the staff we encountered was very helpful and attentive. On our way out, we were wished a good evening by each and every staff member that we walked past on our way out. Surely, MJs is on the higher end of the price range but you definitely get what you pay for. We cannot wait to be back!"
07/23/2022,FrankieBoy,5.0,Our servers were amazing and so attentive. The food was delicious. I simply love the place. Highly recommended.
07/23/2022,FrankT,5.0,We had an amazing experience! It was our anniversary and they gave us each a small glass of sparkling wine when we sat down. We started with the crab cake and charred tomato soup. Both were great but the crab cake was phenomenal. My husband had the NY strip and I had a 7oz filet with a side of scallops. We had a side of the corn off the cob…yum. Steaks were cooked to our request and were amazing. Then came dessert….Baked Alaska. I made it a point to save room for this. I’d have to say the crab cake and the Baked Alaska were my favorite. The staff was friendly and attentive and our server was great. I can’t wait to go back.
07/23/2022,RobertD,5.0,"We booked a dinner to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary. Upon arrival, the hostess greeted us and wished us a happy anniversary. When we arrived at our booth, two complimentary glasses of champagne were served along with an anniversary card with the signatures of the entire restaurant staff. The service by our waiter Robert was exemplary. The quality of the food was exceptional. At the end of our meal, Robert brought us a complimentary slice of cake with ""Happy Anniversary"" written in syrup on the serving plate. What a great dining experience that will be remembered forever. Excellent service, quality food, very pleasant atmosphere. Highly recommend."
07/23/2022,JohnB,5.0,Our servers were outstanding and the presentation of our meal was top notch.
07/22/2022,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"Great service, but the quality of steaks were not good."
07/22/2022,RachelH,1.0,"Overdone steak
Gross
Staff was very nice and fixed our bill"
07/22/2022,AyoH,5.0,Phenomenal food! Great service! Fun times
07/21/2022,JoanneR,5.0,Our waiter and the waitstaff could not have been nicer. The steaks were cooked perfectly and we were given complimentary champagne to celebrate our anniversary! A very enjoyable evening!!!
07/21/2022,ASJr,5.0,"Hands down, easiest the best Delmonico Steak I’ve ever had. Cooked to perfection and the char on the outside, my god, on point!"
07/21/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Server And her assistant were great!  Food was good
07/21/2022,TerryS,4.0,"Service was great!!
Food always delicious and cooked perfectly."
07/20/2022,BD1419,5.0,"Fortunately, we were walked through the high noise area and were seated in a quieter place.  The food was very good except that the broccolini pieces under the scallops were thick and very tough - like eating wood twigs - probably meant to be al dente.  Melissa, our waitress, was great.    We will ask for her next time.   On our previous visit we had the fillet mignon.  It was the best ever.  The mashed potato trio side dish was good except I didn't care for the onion version.  A better variety would have been garlic mashed.  We enjoyed the dining experience and definitely recommend it."
07/20/2022,ronl,5.0,"Outstanding, food, service was fantastic.
We don't go out very much so when we do we want it count and Jordan's delivered tenfold.
Thanks again,"
07/19/2022,MJW5,5.0,Food and service are always on top of their game. Great place.
07/17/2022,James,5.0,Great food and ambience. Our server Chris was very kind and helpful. Definitely recommend eating here!
07/17/2022,sam1023,5.0,Always enjoy ourselves here. The service is impeccable. There’s no denying the bread with the cheese sauce is to die for. Oysters excellent. Steaks cooked to perfection.
07/17/2022,AllisonC,5.0,"Despite my request for a quiet spot, hostess gave us a table in the back next to a party of 8 near the kitchen. The waitress was kind enough to move us a nice quiet booth. Big difference. The food was great and plentiful, the best restaurant in the Casino, although we didn't try Tao, which I heard is really good. I had a filet, asparagus and trio of mashed potatoes. My husband had the pork chop. All was delicious. I was too full for the 23 layer cake but next time."
07/17/2022,Kyle,5.0,"Excellent food, excellent drink, excellent service. I would absolutely go there again and recommend it to a friend."
07/16/2022,restaurantgoer123,5.0,Amazing service and food!! It was our first time there and the waiter took his time. The garlic bread appetizer was the best thing I ever ate!
07/16/2022,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Our server was very attentive and answered our questions and gave recommendations. Garlic bread was so yummy. And the porterhouse steak for 2 was to die for you and a perfect amount of food. Perfectly cooked and amazing flavor. And had the best house steak sauce. Also got the expresso martini and carrot cake and those were perfect as well. Highly Recommend.
07/16/2022,GIBSON,5.0,"This is our 6th time at MJ's & it was DELICIOUS!!!!
Upgrades  were done in August which as far I""m concerned were not needed but the food quality remained excellent."
07/16/2022,happy,5.0,Very good clean and pleasant servers. Overall nice experience
07/16/2022,HuntingtonGuy,4.0,"The noise level when we visited was loud but in fairness, it was not MJ’s that was creating the noise. There was a loud dance contest at a nearby club across from the restaurant. The doors to MJ’s were open and the music was very loud. I suspect that is not the norm. 
Other than that issue we were very happy and our server, Allyson, deserves special mention, she was outstanding."
07/15/2022,Ambss,5.0,"Definitely worth the money ! The service was great once we walked in , the food was great phenomenal. Will return soon ❤️"

07/15/2022,BarbraB,5.0,The food and service are always amazing.  We love how they do not rush you out and allow you to enjoy your drinks and dinner at a comfortable place.
07/15/2022,MichaelO,5.0,"Food was phenomenal. Cut the fillet with a fork. Waitress was amazing, not to pushy, but gave enough attention. Very helpful with sharing parts of our dinner.  

Drinks were fabulous: Jordan crush and the peachy spice.  So good."
07/14/2022,CarolB,5.0,"Our dinner was enjoyable:) from the time we entered the hostess named Amanda was very very pleasant and helpful.  Our server Rob was extremely gracious, prompt and treated us with the upmost respect as well as Kyle at the bar he was an awesome person!  The manager was very friendly and came over and greeted us which was very enjoyable thank you to all the staff and the food was excellent at Michael Jordan steakhouse!"

Love to comeback with my girlfriend in future or myself. 
Love the steak that I to go next morning I heated up same condition as restaurant. 

Wish to see you again^^"
07/11/2022,MikaelP,5.0,"Waw,service was one of the best Ive had. Our server Brayn took good care of us and was very humble and friendly and made us feel at home. Food was amazing and delicous."
07/10/2022,HeatherL,4.0,"Steak was great but service was not well coordinated.  Salads brought to the table at different times.  Sides came shortly after steak.  I'd expect a restaurant that sells a $200 meal to have this type of basic service down to a science. 
Getting a 7 oz steak on an enormous plate while sides come separately does not give you an experience that you are getting a lot for your money.  
Dessert was absolutely disappointing.  Creme Brule was thin and luke warm.  
Restaurant ambiance was great but not real impressed with the service, plating, or dessert."
07/10/2022,TVsFrankismyDad,5.0,"Expensive, but worth the price. Nice atmosphere - a little more lively than most steakhouses. Attentive service. Overall, a very nice place for dinner."

07/09/2022,MichaelD,5.0,Everything was fresh and prepared perfect. We have eaten here before and highly recommend.
07/09/2022,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Good and service were excellent as usual. The drink prices have gotten outrageous. 20$ for a martini. Come on. That’s ridiculous.
07/09/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Love our Bartenders!
07/09/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great place very dark. May have been my seat location
07/08/2022,paulg,5.0,"It was our anniversary and we were treated like royalty. Our waitress Sarah was better than superb and the bar tender was perfect?  The meal was perfect and we would highly recommend this restaurant to everyone who wants a special experience,  great evening"
07/07/2022,JesseH,5.0,Exceptional! very attentive service !!! It was a phenomenal anniversary experience they even sent complimentary champagne to the table. Food was great - drinks were on point . Will go back again!
07/07/2022,Robp,3.0,"It was noisy making it hard to hear our conversation. With the amount of empty tables, I'm not sure why the service was so slow. The staff was personable enough and the manager did stop by to ""see how everything was"" but overall the night wasn't worth the price."
07/07/2022,KimH90,5.0,"Pricey but amazing food. We got the delmonico and Australian wagyu steaks with sides of Mac and cheese and broccolini. Everything tasted just go damn good. The sauces our steaks came with were a perfect match with the types of meats we got. You can tell a lot of thought and attention to detail were put into the menu. Personally, was the huge fan of the broccolini! Had the key lime pie for dessert which was a great contrast to the heaviness of our dinner. Not normally a cocktail person, but gave several of them a try - drinks were very tasty."
07/07/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Yummy! Garlic bread with cheese dipping sauce is amazing! Steak was very tasty, though you should ask for the tomato butter topping on the side

Was going to eat somewhere else tonight but may have to just go back again!!!"
07/06/2022,JAMESG,5.0,Great as always!!
07/06/2022,KevinR,5.0,Best steaks i have ever eaten. Highly recommend michael jordorns steakhouse
07/06/2022,EllaP,5.0,"New menu items! YUMMMM

It was the first day of changes to the menu and we definitely enjoyed the tomato soup! Had a little kick to it that doesn't linger so you can enjoy your meal! The new striped bass had such a delicious curry flavor! My new ""go to"" has become the Salmon! The lemon freshness added to the farro is such a great compliment to the fish, so healthy as well! Of course the NY strip with that addictive pickled garlic and a side of corn was part of the meal. Another A+ and why we keep going back! 

The booths are being renovated and look great so far. Looking forward to seeing the final result!

Dallas and team are so focused on providing the best overall service and this visit was another bullseye! THANK YOU AGAIN TO ALL!"
07/06/2022,JustinH,5.0,The food was excellent and the service is spectacular. It’s a little pricey but you definitely get what you pay for. And the drinks that they make are heavenly. I can’t wail to go back.
07/05/2022,KathyM,5.0,Hadn't been here in years.  It was awesome!  Service & food both outstanding
07/04/2022,JohnS,2.0,"The steaks compared to what they use to be are of lesser quality. I assume with the cost of beef  they are trying to save money.  But in this case they lost a customer forever. 
The sides menu has changed and none were to our liking like they use to be.  The manager did take the sides off the bill when he saw we did not eat them 

They need to get back to the basics of dining.  Service was great it was the choice and quality of food that was the issue.  

Something has drastically changed here.  We use to love going. 

Never again."
07/03/2022,JenniferT,5.0,Server Chris was such a nice guy. Food was good.

06/30/2022,LizPoPo,5.0,"Our dinner was fabulous, the steak was cooked perfectly, just way too much for one person so we had boxes filled to take home!  App (bread) and sides were delicious, the steak frites were a bit soft, prefer crispier!  All in all, great meal!"

06/26/2022,Sallyb,5.0,"Everything great and our server, Brian went the extra mile when I mentioned I would like the blue cheese fondue sauce on the side with my steak."
06/26/2022,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"I’ve been to MJ’s quite a few times. The new menu and atmosphere are a bummer. The ambiance is definitely not as low key as it used to be…and why get rid of the lobster mashed? We usually have great service, this time…not so much. This was our birthday/special occasion/valentines spot..so we came at least 4-6 times a year…we’ll be back but not as often, looking for a new celebration spot."
06/25/2022,celestec,5.0,This is my 2nd time here and I have to say it is one of the best places to eat. The garlic is amazing.
06/25/2022,ReginaO,5.0,Thoughtful touch with the birthday card on the table. Our server was very informative and did not rush us.
06/25/2022,JohnT,5.0,Pricey but worth it for a special occasion. Would definitely return.

06/19/2022,NancyP,4.0,"Great dinner overall.
My husband ordered a medium rare steak which came out medium well done.
The staff did a nice job rectifying.

06/19/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Amazing  service from door to table. Welcoming warm atmosphere! Everyone went above and beyond to satisfy. Would HIGHLY recommend this for any occasion.
06/19/2022,BryRayRay,3.0,Subpar food for the price point.  Been here before several times in the past.  I am far from cheap.  Most certainly did not feel that I got what I paid for.
06/19/2022,SummerT,3.0,"We visited on Father’s Day, the restaurant is darkly lit (need a light to see the oversized menu)and the menu shape is too large to fit the  small table. The garlic bread was tasty but not a large portion size for the table. The large menu over compensate for the small portion sizes. It’s expensive very expensive and not worth the experience. Basic steak house."
06/19/2022,Nikkikay,3.0,"I’ve been many times before, and it has always been good.  This time it took a long time for the waitress to even greet us.  Unacceptable.  Also, the steak was super dry.  They cut the meat off the bone of the porterhouse.  They’ve never done that before.  I’m not sure if that caused the dryness.  The seasoning of the meat was okay."
06/18/2022,DougW,3.0,"Nice steaks, nice salads, not so nice sides"
06/18/2022,HelenM,5.0,"The food was outstanding. I ordered the shrimp cocktail , the shrimp were large and very good. The loaded baked potato is so tremendous. Recommend highly"

Dessert was our only complaint- tasted old. Choc layer cake. 
Perfect night!!"
06/15/2022,kevin,5.0,I decided to sit at the bar sine it was just me for dinner. The service was pleasant and friendly. The filet that I ordered was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth.

06/12/2022,JenelleR,5.0,"We had an amazing meal at MJ's. Started with the garlic bread. It was buttery and crispy and we could have drank the blue cheese fondue it was so good. The chef let us order the Tomahawk off menu and it was the best steak I have ever had. Cooked perfectly. So flavorful. The mushrooms with garlic aioli and corn off the cob were also delicious. Our server was attentive, cordial, and give us a great experience. We can't wait to go back!"
06/12/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Friendly staff.  Accommodated our request for an open booth.  Timely and attentive servers.  Food was excellent and good quality. Price was very fair.
06/12/2022,TaraV,4.0,"Went to celebrate my husband's birthday.  We had reservations and they seated us immediately, which was great, as we were seeing a show after dinner. The steaks are always amazing. We split a salad to start and had the mashed potato trio on the side.  They brought out a little dessert for my husband."
06/12/2022,SheilaC,5.0,We always enjoy dinner at MJs. Pricey but worth it all around.
06/12/2022,davids,2.0,"We had enjoyed coming here the past seven years to celebrate our wedding anniversary. In the past we were treated special like it meant something to come here for the occasion 
A new chef has taken over and the first thing is the change in Cesar salad, we could get better at the Olive Garden! They also eliminated some the steaks
Advice change isn’t always good"
06/11/2022,Rocky,5.0,"The food was wonderful, started off with the leak soup (great) then the Wagyu meatballs which were also pretty awesome. then my filet mignon was cooked perfectly and the lobster fantastic. and the service was the best. Can't go wrong, GREAT FOOD, DRINK AND SERVICE."
06/11/2022,WayneT,5.0,Wonderful steak house. Staff were friendly and attentive. The food was fantastic.
06/10/2022,JamesC,5.0,The food was incredible and the service so great. We had a wonderful time.
06/10/2022,Larry,3.0,"My steak was cooked correctly but had too much salt. Creamed Spinach had too as well. My friends Salmon was very good but again the vegetable side had too much salt.
Oysters were superb and so was our waitress!
We had key lime pie for dessert and the graham cracker crust tasted stale and the whipped cream topping also tasted off.
I’ve eaten at many excellent restaurants and have usually been happy. Last night was disappointing to say the least. If your cooking a $75 steak, season it it yes, but don’t overdo it!
Larry Becker"
06/10/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Perfect bday experience.  Shishito peppers are yummy!  Lamb was delicious and the wine pairing suggestion on point!  Love this place!
06/10/2022,OpenTable Diner,1.0,First time trying it but it did equate to other steakhouse experiences I have had. The portions are not typical steakhouse sizes and for the price you are just paying for the MJ name
06/09/2022,Awesome,4.0,"Food is excellent but the wines / drinks are way too pricey. Especially the bottle of wines, most ober $90 a bottle"
06/07/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Always an outstanding dining experience

06/05/2022,AngelaM,3.0,"Not woth the money.
Service was not at the most expensive restaurant level.
Food was ok but again not at the level I expected."
06/04/2022,CarrieM,3.0,"Ordered the porterhouse for two, disappointed with the choice for the cost.  Should have gotten filets instead.  Sides were great, octopus appetizer was great.  
Impossible to get a drink at the bar before dinner…stood there for 20 minutes without being acknowledged.  
Would much prefer their booth seating to the tables. Totally different experience."

05/30/2022,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Service was professional and friendly 
Food was ehh
I’ve been here many times and food was much better seems to have taken a step towards being more casual 
Food wasn’t superb but definitely put together maybe a Sunday night is when the chef has off? I will give it another try"
05/30/2022,jasonl,5.0,Chris Klein is the best waiter he knows what we want before we need it I guess we come here for him and food is the best
05/29/2022,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"My husband and I had booked a reservation well in advance.  We arrived a little early and they sat us at a high top in the front of the restaurant.  That would have been okay if it hadn’t been in the bar area.  Instead of a nice romantic evening we were subjected to a noise level so loud we couldn’t talk to each other.  When we asked to be moved to a quieter location the manager told us that everywhere was the same in the restaurant and he refused to do anything about it.  The food was really good, if a tad on the pricy side, and the waiter really did his best for us but our night was ruined because of one unprofessional person who couldn’t be bothered to do the right thing when a simple fix was all that was needed.  We walked by the restaurant multiple times that evening while enjoying the casino and can say for sure that the back away from the bar was much quieter than the front even with all the windows open to the casino area."
05/28/2022,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"Quality and taste of Food used to much better years ago…
But now it’s not that great awesome steakhouse I want to go anymore!!!
It’s average"
05/28/2022,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Bday  nice  search the song is a little too long check a little long to get here
05/28/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great food and great wait staff— too pricey to do more often —$250  for 2 people 1 glass of wine-
05/27/2022,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"At Mohegan Sun for volleyball tournament & celebrating my daughters bday. 
Steaks were good.  However my Sancerre wine was warm, after 2 attempts no less, so I just decided against it altogether and our cream spinach was lukewarm."
05/27/2022,Conchita,5.0,We loves the restaurant.   Had a great table.   Enjoyed the ambiance.  The wine was great.   Food was delicious.   Only complaint was the amount of sauce on everything.  So much dressing on a salad.   Mushrooms too much sauce.   Corn loaded with sauce on top.   My halibut drowned in overpowering sauce.   The food was delicious and didn’t need the over abundance of sauces.  Too rich.   Too much!
05/27/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Awesome dinner! Love Jordan's
05/27/2022,Fran,5.0,Food and Service was very good.  Noise level was a little high at the time.

05/16/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,I have eaten at most of the high end steak houses in Manhattan and this by far was the best steak I have ever had.
05/16/2022,HectorQ,5.0,Friendly courteous staff amazing food recommend going here if you come to Mohegan
05/15/2022,MaMm,5.0,Had a really wonderful dinner. The staff were excellent in making it a wonderful birthday dinner with the Prosecco toast and birthday dessert. The only thing I was disappointed about was they no longer have the really wonderful dinner rolls. I was actually kind of surprised how low quality/crappy the dinner rolls were for a restaurant of this level. However the meal and the non-alcohol speciality drinks were really fabulous. Will definitely be back.
05/15/2022,MichaelT,3.0,service was poor. Not the best experience I have had here. 4 people seated at a 6-person table made conversation difficult.
05/15/2022,NP70,4.0,"Cons:
We made a reservation far in advance and they tried to seat us at a small table immediately inside the entrance where people were lining up to talk to the host.   Not cool.  We refused the table, and waited an additional ten minutes for better seating..

It was a bit loud.  They seemed to be short staffed and the bar was behind so drinks that were ordered with appetizers didnt come out until the food was eaten. 

Pros
The two person porterhouse was phenomenal.   Perfectly cooked and thoroughly enjoyed by us. 

The waiter was buried, but personable and was absolutely doing his best to hustle and take care of his tables."
05/15/2022,lovewoodgrilledfood,2.0,The steak was cold. Pretty disappointing for the cost of a meal.
05/15/2022,EllenN,5.0,Everything was just delicious from the garlic bread blue cheese fondue to the porterhouse steak cooked perfectly oysters with delectable too and the server kate  was amazing
05/15/2022,GuyGuilderland,5.0,Excellent everything .  Great food.  Great service
05/15/2022,MelissaC,1.0,I had reservations for two on Saturday night at the steakhouse our bill came to $250 and I was supposed to get a 16 ounce dry aged Delmonico it was maybe 10 ounces very disappointed in this steakhouse and the quality of the steak
05/15/2022,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"It was good- not great, but good"
05/14/2022,OpenTable Diner,3.0,The $70 Dry age steak was fair at best

05/06/2022,Bella,3.0,"First time at Michael Jordan’s Steak House after several excellent experiences at MJ23 next door.  Given dietary restrictions, we didn’t order full meals and ordered two appetizers each.  Two orders of shrimp cocktail; a salad and a soup.  The shrimp cocktail was amazing - among the best I’ve ever had.   Unfortunately, service was painfully slow, the server was inattentive and overall we felt totally ignored.  We had one “check-in” where the server aimed to confirm his understanding that we had received the shrimp cocktail, we had not.  The restaurant was adequately staffed but we were in the restaurant for 2 hours, the last 30 min waiting to be acknowledged to get our bill and check out.  I would not recommend and we will not return.  So unfortunate."
05/06/2022,jonb,4.0,"Michael Jordans is a delicious steakhouse

04/30/2022,GaryP,5.0,Some meals come with sides and I wish on the menu and the waiter or waitress would inform you of this so you will not have to purchase sides. The waitress staff was very nice.  The tables are very close to one another so if you want an intimate setting you will not get it there.
04/30/2022,ElizabethR,5.0,One of the best upscale restaurants around. Drinks and food were absolutely delish!
04/30/2022,Carolynn,5.0,Excellent food and service.   Never had a  better steak.  Unfortunately half the other guests were drunk and very loud.

04/25/2022,OpenTable Diner,4.0,I had a great visit service was impeccable salad was AMAAAZING steaks were good not great but good sides we picked were the only real let down
04/24/2022,Andrew,5.0,"You know what you're getting into at a steakhouse like this. The prices are arguably a touch higher based on the casino setting, but they're comparable to any other fine steakhouse.

The steak itself is without complaint or flaw. The rest of the menu is relatively small, including the sides (which are delicious). Fairly expansive wine list.

Wonderful and personal service."
04/24/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Dallas is  a superb asset. Made sure everything was perfect. Please make sure he is appreciated. He us a true asset. Food was cooked to perfection.
04/24/2022,GENEC,5.0,"Perfect dinner! Try the 3 potato side, and OMG, the garlic bread in a blue cheese sprizzle, To Die For"
04/24/2022,Elway,4.0,"Overall it was a good dining experience.  The garlic bread fondue was excellent as always.  The porter house steak for two was good - should be great for the price.
The grilled corn as a side dish was good, but they now add sour cream to the top of the corn which takes away from the flavor of the grilled corn.  The complimentary brownie and ice cream dessert was good. 
Service was excellent."
04/24/2022,MatthewT,5.0,"Best menu, best staff, best management. Highly recommend repeat visits. Never ever disappointed"
04/24/2022,BekahH,5.0,Such a great experience! When I booked the reservation I put a special not that it was for our anniversary and the staff went above and beyond to make our night special! When we arrived the front desk said Happy Anniversary and led us to our table right away. Our host was very pleasant and quick. We didn’t wait long for our drinks and appetizers and everything was delicious. We received two complimentary glasses of champagne and a dessert dish with happy anniversary written on it as well as a card signed by the staff! This made our special day even more amazing and we couldn’t be happier with our choice of restaurant! 10/10 recommend this establishment to everyone especially for a special occasion. This experience was the highlight of our day and we cannot wait to go back to enjoy some more delicious food and great service ❤️

04/15/2022,john,2.0,"Not gonna make this long,but in a nutshell first time here and this place was aweful.. except for our waitress and a shrimp coctail everything else was terrible.. my ceasar salad was so disgusting,it wasnt even a salad,it was the gross part of the end of the lettuce stalk that u throw away,just brown and gross.. i got the $50 pork chop that was the biggest waste of money.. it was so dark and dim in there so i couldnt even tell what was meat and waht was bone.. i sawed through it because it was so rough,and took a bite and almost broke a tooth because it was a little bit of gristle with a bone on the bottom..only took 3 bites and was all set with it.. it was so gross.. my wife got the scallops,or should i say raw scallops because it was barely cooked.. it cane 7 of then and she ate 2 1/2 of them.. it was barely lit up in there so when we left it was like leaving a cave going straight into sunlight.. our waitress was very very nice though.. she was pleasant and i tipped her very well because obviously the good has nothing to do with her.. and on top of it all it was my birthday dinner.. $226 bill,that i liked a $20 shrimp cocktail out of all of it. Was not happy at all.. $226 bill and i left there starving.. went to johnny rockets and got a $15 burger that was better than everything i had at mjs steakhouse.. terrible food,overly priced.. would not recommend to anyone.. and will not be returning.. and i go to mohegan once a month with my wife to stay the weekend and we go to tao all the time and tuscany all the time and thats where we will continue to go.. terrible birthday dinner..waste of money"

04/03/2022,StaceyM,5.0,"Monique was a wonderful, knowledgeable and friendly server! We came for a birthday dinner. She went the extra step helping us find a specialty drink and made the perfect recommendation for our entrees. Monique made my BF's celebration memorable and special! Thank you!"
04/03/2022,Dogwithabone,4.0,"Ordered the special of the day- Tomahawk ribeye for two.  It was a little tough/chewy, not what one would expect at a high end steak house and not for $110.  Wedge salad and creamed spinach were very good.  Bread rolls were average. However, service was excellent!"
04/03/2022,Bleu,5.0,One of the best steak houses I've eaten in. The steak was cooked perfectly and very tender and the sides they offer are great.
04/03/2022,SecondChild,5.0,"The ambience was nice, fairly quiet considering the chaos and noise of the casino outside, the food was quite nice (particularly the frites, which were tossed in truffle oil, but in addition, tastes as though they were fried in duck fat, as all frites should be) and the service was outstanding. I had the 23 layer chocolate cake for dessert, as it's Michael Jordan's steakhouse and I had to stay on theme. In retrospect, I wish I had ordered the creme brulee, but the accompanying espresso made for a nice end to the meal. Tanya provided outstanding service, put her in for a raise!"
04/03/2022,Armand,3.0,"Very over priced.  While the food was very good, the steak was expensive to start and did not include the high priced side dishes.  Add a couple of drinks each and coffee and one shared dessert - I don't usually spend $240 (plus $48 tip) for two for dinner!!"
04/03/2022,Blklab,5.0,As always one of our favorite places to eat while we’re here. We probably come about twice a month to eat. Food is always good menus pretty consistent the staff is always more than accommodating and we always leave with a smile on our face.
04/02/2022,PamelaK,4.0,"Came out for a birthday dinner and it was great! Steak was really great, service was great, but the noise level was a bit too high due to rowdy people. Overall I would recommend  this place to anyone."
04/02/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"My husband and I absolutely love going to Michael Jordans!!! We love to celebrate our Wedding anniversary there because the food is great, service is always on point, and we always walk away happy!!! Jen, our server, was also fantastic and made a point to get to know us alittle but even though it was busy!! Highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that stays or visits Mohegan Casino!!!"

04/02/2022,Melo,5.0,Our waitress Melissa was amazing. The food was the best. Still the best filetmigon I've ever had. Last time I was there was for my 21st birthday and ni had the same plate yesterday. Best way to celebrate my Anniversary with my husband.
04/02/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Always a good steak here. Mohegan in general is great!
04/02/2022,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"Got tenderloin for two,
It was barely enough for one. I know you are going to pay a hefty price for a steak at a “high end” steakhouse 
But you expect a portion for two. I will not be going back there soon. There are many far better steakhouses around. Very disappointed"
04/01/2022,Rocky,5.0,"As usual  the food, service, drinks and atmosphere was fantastic. Our waitress Melissa with the braids was fantastic. Once again Dallas and his staff made for another perfect evening, and everyone knew it was our anniversary. I could go on and on about how great everything was but I think I got my point across. And for anyone who's never been there I strongly recommend you try it."
04/01/2022,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Everything was great and the staff were nice
03/31/2022,OpenTable Diner,4.0,All good except the steak had been cooked near or in a grill with shrimp.  45-day Delminico tasted like shrimp and I don’t like shrimp.
03/30/2022,BobV,5.0,Amazing flavors worth the money . Food done correctly .
03/29/2022,AmandaR,5.0,We celebrated my fiancés birthday and it was and all around amazing night and the food was wonderful!

03/28/2022,TheresaH,5.0,Our waitstaff was awesome!!! The food was great!
03/27/2022,JoAnnR,5.0,We were there to celebrate our Anniversary.  First off they brought us champagne and gingerale because they noticed my husband wasn't drinking...very nice!  The steaks were delicious but one had a little bit more fat.  When the check came it was taken off the bill which we couldn't believe because we didn't ask for anything.  Our server Danielle was excellent and we look forward to dinner here again!  Also order the crab cake...it's pricey but all crab meat no fillers!  Thanks!
03/27/2022,TyronW,5.0,Was good shrimp and grits don’t take it off the menu

03/24/2022,GastonD,3.0,We love Michael Jordan’s but last nights server Brian  was preoccupied with other people and did not tend to our needs at all. He never delivered our creamed spinach and wasn’t around when I wanted another glass of wine.  He never checked after steak was delivered if it was cooked properly. Very disappointed with his service.
03/24/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Food = delicious
Service = outstanding 
Exceeded my expectations"
03/23/2022,JDJD,5.0,"Terrific service, knowledgeable waitstaff and delicious food!"
03/22/2022,MelanieD,5.0,My boyfriend and I went for dinner with our 5 month old daughter. I was nervous to bring her as I didn’t want to get weird looks about bringing a baby to a nice restaurant. Every staff member we came across was amazing. Staff that wasn’t even supposed to help us were stopping to see our daughter and talk to us. Our waitress was so nice and everything came out quickly and was delicious. You get what you pay for here!
03/22/2022,JohnD,5.0,"We arrived early and were warmly greeted. Our service staff Melissa and Angel were outstanding! We have dined here on several occasions and have never been disappointed. Our most recent visit was for a special occasion, and they made us feel all the more special. We had a wonderful romantic dinner all thanks for the staff of Michael Jordan's!"
03/22/2022,KimG,5.0,The place was nice the food was amazing just so good . The staff was very nice and attentive. My husband and I had a waitress name Sarah and she was wonderful she was attentive and so nice . I definitely can not wait to go back .

03/20/2022,Jennifer,2.0,Both meals ordered were incorrect. For a high end steakhouse the filet minion was not impressive.
03/20/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,My first time going and the service and food were amazing! Wasn’t so crazy about my cocktail and the sides and add ons I did feel were a small portion for the price but it is fine dining. I would definitely go again!
03/20/2022,EvelynR,3.0,Overly expensive definitely overrated wont go there again.
03/20/2022,DanielH,5.0,"Very good food and ambiance, the staff are always friendly."

03/19/2022,BFrank,5.0,We always enjoy Jordan’s. It’s a little splurge but we’ll worth the occasional experience!

03/18/2022,Jessica,5.0,"Must have the smoked bacon and garlic bread!  Everything was delicious!  Our server Robert was A++! Friendly, knowledgeable, and made my birthday super special."
03/18/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The grill marks and grilled flavor of the filet mignon OMG so very delicious. The sides are ala Carte but shareable. Everyone was nice and accommodating as could be. I dropped my steak knife and someone replaced it within seconds. I Can't wait to return.
03/18/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,First time visit and not sure why it tool us so long to try it. Food and service is wonderful!
03/18/2022,MarkF,3.0,"The service was the best thing. From start to finish, each employee was awesome! Apps were the bacon & the meatballs. The bacon was incredible, the best part of the meal. The meatballs tasted like they were frozen. Dinner was a filet mignon. It was good. The other was a porterhouse steak, order rare & unsliced. Came out rare & sliced. For that kind of $$, you want it how you ordered it. It was good, not great. Overall, we wouldn’t go back. Overpriced for decent food & excellent service."
03/18/2022,Ooreogg,5.0,"MJs never ceases to please us! Love the cheesy garlic bread! Our waitstaff was amazing, always checking on us and great interaction! 23 layer cake?!?!?  So good!!!"
03/17/2022,KA0322,4.0,"Food and service were exceptional, no problems there. But the ambience for a high-end restaurant needs improvement. We specifically started in our reservation that we were celebrating an anniversary, for 2. To be in the same dining room and close to with large parties screaming, clapping, laughing loudly, speaking loudly certainly put a damper on the ambience we were expecting. This definitely put a damper on the evening. For first-time diners, we would have chosen another place if we knew our privacy would be interrupted to this level. We were sitting right next to each other (not across from one another) and we couldn't hear each other speaking. This was disappointing. If I wanted to be exposed to this noise level, we would have sat in the bar."
03/17/2022,OpenTable Diner,1.0,the most crucial part of any steakhouse’s success is the steak…
03/16/2022,None,4.0,Steak was just about the same as I get from Omaha Steak but the bread tower with the fantastic sauce was great!

03/07/2022,SusanC,4.0,Service was phenomenal. Steak was tender for a Kansas City but I had to send the first one back because it was not rare but medium. The second one was cooked right but in general it was very salty. Asparagus was very good the mashed potato trio was bland. I had the Burata salad which was fabulous!
03/07/2022,Chuck,5.0,Enjoyed our evening.  Food was delicious and the staff's menu recommendations were spot on.

03/07/2022,BriMcD10,4.0,"The demonico steak was amazing.  The oysters were very disappointing. They were so small they were not worth it, however the server gave us 1/2 dozen extra on the house to make up for it."

03/05/2022,JoeD,4.0,"We were sat at a table adjacent to the front desk, which made for a very noisy and distracting dining experience. Our sever was very pleasant and prompt and the food, as always, was delicious. If not for the table we were given, it would have been another 5 star meal."

03/01/2022,TyroneW,5.0,My wife and I had a really good time at Micheal Jordan’s Steakhouse.  The service was amazing and the key lime pie was a hit.  I we loved the garlic bread and crab cake we had for appetizers.  The porterhouse steak for two was delicious.  My wife and I will definitely return to this restaurant for another special occasion.  The price was great as well.  The wait staff was very attentive and our glasses stayed full.  Thank you for such a great evening for our wedding anniversary of 25 years.
03/01/2022,SSGG,4.0,"It was SO busy for a Monday night! We were told that a group of unexpected patrons showed up and that put a strain on the staff.  Our food was great.

02/27/2022,JSeNi,4.0,"Service was outstanding. Unfortunately, our food was not. First time we ate here was great and we decode to come back. For our surprise our stake and octopus had burn pieces. Our stake was supposed to be medium well which means no burn parts. It tasted like dirty grill. Our best choice was the mashed potato trio. I hope others may have a better experience."
02/26/2022,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"The service was phenomenal. Entire staff was very attentive. However, the food doesn’t seem to be like what it used to be. One of our steaks was over cooked. Flavor was also lacking. They also changed the butter for their filet mignon. Their bread used to be delicious but that was also changed. Please bring back the old stuff!"
02/26/2022,Alliougana,4.0,"MJ has changed some of their recipes and not in a good way! The corn off the cob dish used to be their best offering. Now it is an unattractive pile of mush that neither looks nor tastes like corn. And the Brussels sprouts used to be crisp and flavorful. Now the are mushy and bland. This was my first time trying the scallops abd was very disappointed in this dish- not tasty and there seemed to be much more mushroom than scallops. My friend did enjoy her baked potato, green salad and steak. Abd we both loved our martinis! Service was outstanding, partly making up for disappointing food."
02/26/2022,RobertC,5.0,Brought my girlfriend out for a nice dinner she’s a big Michael Jordan fan and clearly his career in his playing represents his steakhouse the food was delicious we both got the filet mignon with the meatball appetizer this was her birthday present and at the end of the dinner they surprisingly brought out two glasses of champagne and a small dessert which was also delicious and a very nice surprise I will definitely be going back as I said the food is absolutely delicious the appetizer meatballs or probably some of the best meatballs I’ve ever tasted the staff was Extremely friendly and always making sure that everything was good one of the best dining experiences I’ve ever had
02/26/2022,RobS,5.0,Service was great
02/26/2022,AndrewR,4.0,The steak was just mediocre and did not justify the price. That was NOT prime steak
02/25/2022,Jac41179,5.0,AMAZING As always!
02/24/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great service. Pretty reasonably priced for a steakhouse. Our meals were delicious and our server could not have been any nicer!
02/24/2022,CrystalM,5.0,We came here for our anniversary dinner and had a great time! They gave us a card signed by the staff for our anniversary and also a complimentary toast which I thought was very nice.  My fiancé had the Australian wagyu which was incredible. We are from Boston and typically go to Rare steakhouse inside the Encore casino where he gets domestic wagyu which is over $20 more than the Australian wagyu here and he said it's better! I got the filet which was also incredible and cooked exactly how I wanted it. I also got the loaded baked potato and that was huge and delicious. We definitely will be coming back when we visit Mohegan again
02/24/2022,ClaudiaC,5.0,"Nice place, great service.  Food and drinks were excellent ."

02/22/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Phenomenal. From the Caesar salad and the tuna tartare to the filet mignon and mashed potatoes. Our server Tanya provided just the right amount of care and knowledge. Just perfect.
02/21/2022,OpenTable Diner,2.0,We have been to Michael Jordan’s many times and this time was very disappointing. The food was very bad. We may not go back again.

02/19/2022,AvaG,5.0,Crab cake wasn’t as good as before and it’s more costly . The service was good the only issue was with the host. I arrived prior to my friend who was trying to find parking in the garage and he wouldn’t seat me. A few mins later the female hostess came over and sat me prior to my friend entering the restaurant. I wish they offered the Japanese wagyu.
02/19/2022,MarioG,1.0,"The restaurant should close
The worst meal I ever had! Hard bread, like a rock, gnocchi pasta was dry and burnt, steak was Served with butter on top and the butter didn’t melt because the steak was cold, burnt on the outside and basically raw!!
Mashed potatoes weren’t bad but also cold. Creamed spinach not bad"
02/19/2022,ACB516,5.0,"MJ’s was amazing this time around for my husband’s birthday! Sometimes it’s been hit or miss but this time was stellar - our waitress, Amanda, was EXCELLENT - she was busy but always came back at the right time if we needed something. Food was fabulous and cooked to perfection. Great experience!"
02/18/2022,JeffE,5.0,"Just what we needed.  Date night ( first in YEARS with 3 year old at home.)   Pigged out with a Flight of Meat, plus cold seafood and a 2000 later cake.   Server was FANTASTIC.."

02/16/2022,kellyh,5.0,"The food was phenomenal - our server was Jen and she was beyond outstanding in terms of her demeanor, pleasant, funny, offering suggestions, being attentive to the birthday girl. The other servers who helped clear, poured water were all also pros at what they do - they moved so quickly I did not catch their names but let's just say everyone working there that night was fabulous. The low lighting would make this a nice date or anniversary dinner spot - but the laid back atmosphere could be enjoyed for any occassion."

02/14/2022,HeleneL,4.0,"Usually when we dine here my steak is very good--however the Delmonico was quite tough and a bit less flavorful than I have experienced in the past. Not thrilled, given the costs of the meals. I don't mind spending if the meal is worth it, but this wasn't."

02/13/2022,jojo,3.0,"The porter house steak  for two  is way two small and not a tender piece of meat.
Our waitress was the best. I believe her name was Brandy. The sides were very good.
and they were different. Our waitress brought us two glasses of Champaign and a brownie with ice cream since we were celebrating our Anniversary."
02/13/2022,JohnG,5.0,The steaks are always cooked to perfection and the service is always great.
02/13/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Food and service was excellent! Drinks were great. Will go back again.
02/13/2022,Hav2eat,5.0,"Chris S. was a very good server! Our steaks were cooked exactly the way we ordered them, although my wagyu was a little disappointing. I’m not sure if it’s tough to get a good quality steak because of COVID-19 times. The last time I had gone there and ordered it it was phenomenal and tender. As it should be for a 12 ounce $85 steak. The garlic bread and bacon appetizers were spot on and delicious as always. And ending our meal with the baked Alaska never disappoints. We really appreciated that Chris brought us out a cup of coffee and champagne on the house to celebrate our special night!"
02/13/2022,NYFoodie,3.0,"$43 Scallop plate is a half plate of food, No longer can you add a small lobster tail for $16 to steak to create your own Surf and Turf. Filet Mignon 7 oz was $32, now $48. For my wine taste notable reislings are not on the wine list any longer, my favorite reisling is gone. We ordered a substitute wine that didn’t measure up.  Not the value for your money that you once received at MJs. However service is still ok, staff has a great attitude!
**LATE NOTE- MJs must have seen this review, and CANCELED OUR Open table 100 pt reservation reward, 
EVENTHOUGH WE BOTH ORDERED ENTREES, me the $43 half-plate scallops, and my wife the Short Rib pasta..So WHY THE CANCELED POINTS?"

02/05/2022,WilliamM,5.0,delicious food beautifully presented attentive staff great experience from start to finish. Highly recommend
02/05/2022,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Crab cake was not skimpy on the crab which is a plus, but the sauce got overwhelming salty after the second bite maybe a little sweeter sauce since the crab is already salty. Wagyu meatball tastes like a regular meatballs, but we made a little meatball sub with the rolls they gave us, that was good. I also felt the Delmonico was alright slightly salty too. Alaskan wagyu was delicious. Creamy spinach is also a plus. And the corn off the cob was very delicious so much of its own flavors, perfect side to replenish your tastebuds. Our waitress was awesome too! Overall not a bad place !"
02/05/2022,EdwardJ,5.0,"I would absolutely dine at the restaurant again.The somlier Ryan was awesome. ,he directed us to a perfectly paired bottle.The meal choice of Ribeye Tomahawk in Madeira Wine smothered in mushrooms was over the top.The garlic bread and wedge salad were also great ."

02/03/2022,JeffreyC,4.0,"It wasn't the best I have ever gone to. It was a good meal. To be fair, I wasn't very hungry and ordered a small filet. A filet is far from the tastiest piece of meat to order, but it was good. Cooked how I asked. The sides were very good. Again, really nothing to complain about, just wasn't wowed!"
02/03/2022,kristine,5.0,Nick was a wonderful server. Very knowledgeable and professional.  He helped make our experience outstanding

02/01/2022,ChelseaR,5.0,Food was amazing! Robert our server was fantastic! Highly recommend the crab cake
01/30/2022,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"It was my fiancé’s birthday, I ordered the Delmonico steak. Despite the fact that it was cooked to the right temperature It was extremely charred all over and burnt on one edge. My fiancé ordered the Salmon, and the portion was ridiculously small for the price, approximately 2” X 5” and the eggplant that accompanied it was under cooked and slimy in texture. The quality and portion size was no where near worth the cost! I paid $240 for a dinner that I could have gotten at Texas Roadhouse that would have been not only cheaper but better!
I’ve had much better cuts of meat and fish that were prepared correctly and proper portions at Ruth Chris steakhouse for a comparable price to yours.
The service was great for sure.
I refused to make a big issue of it at the time considering the occasion. I didn’t want to make it worse. 
Definitely not worth the money!
We won’t be back to say the least."
01/28/2022,DennisG,5.0,Our evening at Michael Jordan’s Steakhouse at Mohegan was phenomenal. They chose a booth for the three of us. It was quieter than the tables in the main dining area. Our dinner was exceptional. The service even better. It was such a treat to have service that was at the stellar level. They made our evening totally enjoyable. Can’t wait to return.
01/28/2022,Chelsea,5.0,"My server was excellent....

01/24/2022,Seymour,3.0,The service was great but the Wagyu was tough and chewy even when asked for a medium cook. Overall the drinks were strong but a bit lacking on flavor. Fantastic Frozen Alaska dessert but a bit pricey for the quality of the meat served.
01/24/2022,JamesW,5.0,Wonderful!
01/23/2022,Cath,5.0,We had fantastic service!  It was a great date night out!

01/21/2022,AnthonyC,5.0,This was probably the 20th time I have been to mj’s and as always it was spot on. The garlic bread with blue cheese is a must for an app. Steaks and sides were cooked to perfection as always and a our waiter Chris K was great. Chris was spot on with recommendations and was very personable.
01/21/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,50th Birthday for my fiancé. Y’all are always extremely accommodating and service and staff are absolutely awesome. Thank you for making her Birthday just a little more special!
01/21/2022,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Steak cooked perfect  ambiance was nice except we were not finished and apparently around 9pm the lights went from dim to bright .. like they were getting ready to close  they didn’t rush us but to late the mood already changed
01/19/2022,Eddie,4.0,"We are regulars at MJ, we have been coming to eat here for years. We were excited to be back and eat one of our favorite dishes the wagyu steak. The price went up but we still ordered it and was disappointed. We both noticed right way and questioned the quality of the steak and the method it was cooked. We asked the steak to be cooked medium and it was almost cooked med well to well done. I could not finish almost have of the steak because it was like cutting into a piece of charcoal. Very disappointed."
01/17/2022,TimA,5.0,"Awesome experience. Steaks were cooked perfectly, the tuna cevece was fresh...can't say enough good about it."

01/17/2022,REBECCAS,3.0,The service was very good but the food was very disappointing. We each ordered the filet mignon and they were well done instead of the medium rare.  Our friends ordered the porter house for 2 and that was also overcooked. The sides we ordered were good.
01/16/2022,Kimberlyw,5.0,Delmonico was cooked perfectly! Everything was great especially our server!!!

01/16/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Food was delicious, service was excellent. In my 15+ visits here the steak is always cooked PERFECT. The breadstick appetizer is a must try. Corn for a side is always a win. Atmosphere was a little loud, but it was just people having fun on a Saturday night and I’m basically an old curmudgeon"
01/16/2022,JenniferB,5.0,Absolutely delicious!!! Great date night or night out with friends !!

01/14/2022,OpenTable Diner,2.0,I was definitely disappointed with my recent dining experience at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse. My guest and I each ordered a steak with him having the 10oz filet and I having the Kansas City. His filet was burnt and my steak was very tough and salty. The side of corn which is normally delicious was less than satisfactory as it appeared to be overdone. We did dine later in the evening and it seemed like there was a significant lack of attention to detail perhaps due to the time of our visit. We are both pretty good players at Mohegan Sun and were looking forward to a great meal but sadly that isn't how it went. We did complain to the manager on duty (Mike) but was told we should have complained before finishing our meal. He did take off a couple of the appetizers and gave us a dessert on the house but honestly just feel it wasn't good enough. I seriously doubt I will revisit anytime soon as I feel the food quality has declined significantly. Thank you for your time and I hope you find this feedback helpful.
01/14/2022,ShannonM,5.0,We were celebrating a birthday and the staff really made us feel special with touches like champagne and a signed bday card.

01/13/2022,karenb,5.0,The service was amazing!! Our waitress made the meal.
01/13/2022,Anna,5.0,Michael Jordan’s never disappoints!! The renovations are beautiful and we got 4 seats at the big new bar. The service was exceptional as always and the dinner was equally as good. I had the steak frites (first time!) and it was delicious!  The steak was perfectly cooked and the French fries were crisp and hot. My husband had the short rib pasta - one of his favorite dishes. Our friends split the strip steak and loved ever bite!
01/12/2022,danu,5.0,"Noise level I mean as low, very nice.
I am an old timer been going to MJ’s since opening in Mohegan Sun.
My go to Best Restaurant there.
Staff always professional and friendly.
Food items always great if there was ever something wrong would not be a problem. I am sure they would make it rite.
Restaurants in a Casino tend to be extra Friendly."
01/11/2022,JeanneS,3.0,Having been a patron of Mohegan sun Michael Jordan’s steakhouse for many years we were a bit disappointed with the restaurant during this stay. I always accepted the restaurant was typically a little pricey. We found this time the prices to be extremely high. Where I use to pay 50.00 range for a steak was now 70.00 dollars. Items that I always looked forward to having are no longer on menu. Items like the wedge salad with blue cheese and lobster mashed potatoe are no longer offered. I can say one area that was not changed was the quality of food and exceptional service staff. Honestly I think we will be trying other restaurants during future stays at Mohegan sun.
01/10/2022,SandraP,5.0,"Always great food and service.  We had late night reservations so noise level was minimal, but it can get noisy when full during peak hours.  Even though we were the last couple dining before they closed, we were not rushed and the staff was very gracious and accommodating.  We have dined there many times and have never been disappointed.  We will be back soon!"

01/07/2022,jasonl,5.0,Omg it’s the best Chris Klein is the best .my kids love the macaroni and cheese it’s great
01/07/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The food was amazing and service exceptional.   We went for our anniversary with another couple. We were treated very well. The booth seating cut down the noise from the rest of the restaurant-Made the experience more intimate and relaxing.  We were never rushed.  The drink and wine selection was phenomenal.  Prices are as expected for the venue, but I would add that aside from the steak everything else is a bit over priced.  That is the only slightly negative statement I will make. The waitress was funny and attentive but not crowding us.  The sommelier was very helpful.  Food was cooked well and tasty.  I was very surprised at the number of kids at the restaurant.  They were all well behaved and did not detract from the experience.   Will definitely go back soon!"
01/07/2022,StoryK,5.0,"Everything was amazing! We had the wagyu meatballs and garlic bread for starters. Our server was very accommodating and allowed us to do the half order of garlic bread so we didn’t fill up. Our food runner was awesome in the sense that he explained all the ingredients/ garnishing and even gave personal recommendations. I had the 7oz. Filet mignon and it was delicious and so tender! The creamed spinach may be one the best I’ve had as well. My boyfriend had the Australian wagyu, and it was a large portion & flavor was great.
We would definitely come back here (and we actually may one more time before we leave)"
01/07/2022,RDRev,5.0,Our server was great and the porterhouse for two was excellent as usual.
01/06/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Been going to MJ’s the past ten years for our anniversary. Wouldn’t think to go anywhere else to celebrate!!!
Best Steak house in my opinion!!!"
01/04/2022,Norwichgirl,5.0,"We ordered the Tomahawk steak based on the recommendation from our server and she was spot on. Melissa, our server, was fantastic. She made us feel very welcome and not rushed which seems to happen in many restaurants these days. We had no electric or heat at home and were in no hurry to leave. She understood our dilemma and was very kind and patient.  She was so accommodating and even rectified our vegetable order which was way too spicey. Overall wonderful experience with great table and bar service. One of the best martini's I ever had!"

01/02/2022,Shannon,3.0,The ambiance was nice but my steak was very over cooked and my friends shake was very undercooked. Overall not worth the money.
01/02/2022,CindyC,5.0,"Food was delicious! Every streak, the potato trio and asparagus too!
Octopus was delicious too.  Expensive but worth it for a special occasion"

01/02/2022,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Not my best experience here, have been a few times and this time just ok… the back of the house is a much better experience"
01/02/2022,MissCityFood,4.0,"Tammy, our server was excellent. Rolls were warm when brought to the table; I wished the prime Delmonico steak was brought to the table hot. It was prepared medium to medium rare (as ordered) but flavorless - perhaps because it was sliced in the kitchen and not rested enough. The kitchen split the Caesar salad between two people and it was small but still tasty. The side of mushrooms came out along with the steak and was hot due to being served in a cast iron dish. As an accompaniment to the lukewarm steak it was perfect. Service was excellent despite it being very business so we will return and try the ribeye or tomahawk (unsliced)."
01/01/2022,CraigL,2.0,Went for our anniversary pretty loud and had doors open next to us while eating alot dust from people walking outside also took a while for out meal and was cold when we received our meal and drinks way overpriced ballo has alot less priced drinks
01/01/2022,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Was amazing, besides the new year we were celebrating my wife’s birthday, they gave us the best treatment ever, they served us in excellence, my wife received a birthday card and a wonderful treatment. The food was delicious, in every prep and detail, they treat us like kings and queens!!"
01/01/2022,Rocky,5.0,"Another enjoyable two evenings (30th and 31st) at our favorite restaurant. The food, service and atmosphere was great both nights. Adrian on the 30th and Robert on the 31st. tried some different things and was completely happy with everything, especially the Grilled corn off the cob and the truffle parmesan was a great add on to a perfectly cooked Filet Mignon. The Halibut was one of the best my Girlfriend ever had. Once again two more great nights and dinners. Dallas and his staff are the best there are and we will continue to keep going back."
12/31/2021,OpenTable Diner,4.0,We were seated immediately and service was excellent.
12/31/2021,SandraB,5.0,"Nichole was our waitress,  and we were very impressed with her attentiveness and concern for what we needed.  she went above and beyond."
12/30/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We love this steakhouse, one of our most favorite restaurants. Service was great, managment is great, food is outstanding always."
12/30/2021,RobinD,5.0,"There were 4 in our party and we all got the large filet mignon, medium. Three were juicy and perfect. One was over cooked and dry. Everything else was perfect."
12/30/2021,LindsayP,5.0,Our server Amanda was awesome !! She was so friendly and really made our dinner so special. It was our first time here and we will definitely be back on our next Mohegan trip !
12/30/2021,DavidH,4.0,Overall a decent experience.  Probably not worth the money but the best option at Mohegan Sun
12/30/2021,Holl,3.0,"Very unimpressed with Michael Jordan's after their re-opening. This was one of our favorite restaurants at Mohegan, but not sure if we'll be returning. Food was not the quality we were used to and the service from the staff was extremely lacking."
12/29/2021,TimothyF,5.0,Another outstanding meal! Steaks are amazing! Service was great! Best restaurant in Mohegan/Foxwoods area!
12/29/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great food and service
12/29/2021,brittanyH,4.0,Sirloin was way too rare but still delicious. Rest of food amazing
12/29/2021,RichP,3.0,"My wife and I made a reservation for 8pm. The service was excellent, but some of the food items were very questionable. We ordered the 7oz. Filet mignon and I ordered a 10 oz. flank steak, both were very delicious. We had broiled scallops and shrimp, both were delicious. For sides, we ordered a mashed potato sampler which was medicore at best. Our vegatable was roasted asparagus which was absolutely horrible, we had the waiter take it back which he removed from our bill. Overall, it was okay for first-timers. I personally think that for the price you're paying, it could be far better for all the hype I heard about MJ's steakhouse. Previously, we went to the MJ sportsbar which quite ironically, was much better experience at more reasonable prices."
12/29/2021,JudyC,4.0,Very busy. Had to wait a little past our reservation time. At least 1/2 hour. After that service and food was great
12/27/2021,PaulA,5.0,"The steaks, salads, sides and dessert were even better than I expected - and I'd been here before. However, the one thing that stood out above everything else was the service. Perfect in every way especially our server who was friendly, answered every question and served our meal the perfect temperature and without delay. An incredibly good experience at this restaurant."
12/27/2021,Bella,5.0,"Amazing service and food. We enjoyed so much! The staff was super kind, we had a great experience."
12/26/2021,MichaelK,3.0,It was fine no comparison to “Rare” in the Encor
12/26/2021,Vozzy,5.0,"Love the new renovation and layout.  Our server, Allison was knowledgeable and attentive and very friendly, food was excellent as always.  A very enjoyable evening.  Will definitely be back when in the area again."
12/26/2021,TimF,5.0,The MJ steakhouse at Mohegan was awesome!  We had a great experience for Christmas dinner!
12/26/2021,Foodie,4.0,"The lobster meal was tough and underwhelming. Also was very disappointed Michael Jordan's doesn't enforce the ""no hat"" policy!  In my opinion, you charge the prices Jordan's charges, I would expect the Mgt to enforce traditional etiquette!"
12/25/2021,JoanB,5.0,Michael Jordans was a great place for Christmas dinner. Our waiter was fantastic. The food was hot and delicious.
12/25/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Enjoyed a Christmas dinner with wife and friends. If you are not aware of the prices you need to review them before you go. 1 steak (no sides) will run $45 to $120. A dinner for four will easily cost $500 and up. But the food is delicious!
12/25/2021,stevent,5.0,Outstanding service and food quality. Drinks were the best
12/25/2021,Lambchopporky,5.0,Michael Jordans is a great place. Food is excellent. The lemon drop martini made with fresh lemon is excellent. I wish they would put the wedge salad back on the menu.  Service was perfect. Didn’t rush us at all. The 23 layer cake is absolutely delicious. Perfect to split with others.
12/25/2021,Really,2.0,"Service was good, blows my mind that no one asked me why I left most of my steak on my plate. Side note to cook, you should have taken my fillet of the grill about an hour sooner. I didn’t want to complain, being Christmas Eve. I had surgery 4 days prior, and didn’t have the energy to deal with it. Last but not least. I’ve been eating there from day one, and generally food is good. I guess every restaurant is allowed to provide a bad meal now and then."
12/25/2021,Damir,5.0,Very nice steakhouse... great atmosphere! Very pleasant and knowledgeable staff.
12/25/2021,MelO,3.0,It was ok. Nothing special for the price. My steak wasn’t cooked to my liking but we waited  for a while for the food to come out so it wasn’t worth the extra wait.
12/24/2021,Mitchb,5.0,"Third time dining here. Service was impeccable, food was amazing. It is my go to when visiting Mohegan. Could not fit in dessert, from appetizers to mains everything was phenomenal.

Little bit on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for. If you want a great steak, this is your place."
12/24/2021,EricaM,5.0,"Shirley, Kyle, Tom, Sebastian, Tim, Nick, Tyler, Dallas and the rest made it absolutely wonderful 😊"
12/24/2021,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Remodel was nice. Waited the longest we ever had for server to come over and take drink order- even longer to get drinks. Some menu  items were different and not as good - maybe new purveyors? Most likely COVID related issues caused changes.
12/19/2021,brucej,5.0,"birthday night for our son.     Dallas, the manager, came to table to congratulate.    extremely professional.     mj's issued a birthday desert/with candle.     our waiter performed perfectly and professionally.     food was great.     been there numerous times.    surely seems to continually be a well run establishment."
12/19/2021,ShirleyM,5.0,We enjoyed the wonderful food and comfortable setting.
12/19/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great service and food
12/19/2021,Amy5,4.0,"Birthday.  Good had wonderful taste, drink list could be better.  Loved the experience but a little pricey but. I will go back"
12/18/2021,DianaP,5.0,We love dining at Michael Jordan’s Steakhouse. Great atmosphere and the food is excellent. Our waitress Allison was friendly and very attentive. We will be back!
12/18/2021,tinar,3.0,Garlic bread was burnt on the bottom.  Then On some pieces the bottom was cut off completely to hide the fact the bottom was burnt. Crab cakes were not worth $40.
12/17/2021,TaraV,3.0,"Steak is still good, but I miss the delicious rolls and the lobster mashed."
12/17/2021,UncleRandy,5.0,Our Server Danielle was fantastic last night. Took care of everything we needed.
12/15/2021,izmirf,5.0,everything was great food was excellent will be back for sure
12/14/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Good food , mid week but very busy and rather
  Loud"
12/12/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great!!! Great food fast service both of us were very pleased
12/11/2021,Russ,5.0,excellent and courteous staff food was cooked to our groups satisfaction
12/11/2021,Jason,5.0,Sara was awesome!
12/11/2021,JamesB,5.0,When we want steak we go to Michael Jordan's. Christmas gift for the both of us was to eat there. Will be back again!
12/10/2021,ToddS,5.0,"Service was great! Kamee was amazing!  Steaks were best we've had here! Bone 45 day aged sirloins were the SO flavorful.  And others had the 7 oz filet which was tender and perfect sized after salads, bred (with awesome butter), loaded baked potato (big enough for 4 of us to split), corn off the cob etc.!  Great atmosphere, great wine, all in all one o the best experiences we've had t MJ's!!!!"
12/10/2021,CraigL,1.0,Went for our anniversary i requested quiet table they put us next to a large loud Christmas party food was ok little pricey for what you get might not recommend and im n a wheelchair asked to keep it close by manager put it way n back no were to be found incase of emergency thats not cool
12/09/2021,Jason,5.0,Ryan always make you feel welcome and it was great to meet Dallas.  See you tomorrow night!
12/09/2021,gustavol,5.0,We had a reservation for 5:00 p.m. Halfway through our dinner a group (maybe 30 plus began to take up space in front of our table.  Perhaps a holiday celebration.  The manager had to be called. Worst experience ever during a private celebration.
12/08/2021,EllenB,4.0,"Was a little disappointed on the shrimp cocktail.  The sauce was boring, needed some horseradish and they could have been colder.  Other than that, we enjoyed our meal!"
12/06/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,My husband and I have eaten here 3x now and we LOVE this steakhouse. The food was magnificent! Tried raw oysters for the first time and they were outstanding as well as the steak and lamb chops we ordered. Our server I think his name was Robert was great. I have enjoyed this place all 3 occasions. Our favorite date night spot from the drinks to dessert did not disappoint.
12/05/2021,Donald,5.0,The service and food were both fantastic!  The Mac & Cheese is a must have!
12/05/2021,CathyL,3.0,"I felt the food, from garlic bread to my lobster dish was way too buttery.  I like my food to be on the plain side."
12/05/2021,MaryP,1.0,"It seems that MJs is going down hill.  I guess they no longer wash the lettuce since I found girt and dirt in mine.  Mushrooms were undercooked.  How do you undercook. Mushrooms?  The filet was over cooked and not medium.  Service was on the slow side despite the fact that we had an early reservation and not that many customers were there yet.  Since all of my party had the salad, we all got sick.  We all had a different main course, so it was probably the salad."
12/05/2021,Britt,4.0,"I liked the food choices however I felt our steaks could’ve been more seasoned and my parmesan truffle fries didn’t have any salt on them. Overall the restaurant was a great time. I went for my husband’s birthday, the staff did a great job helping us celebrate, and we plan to come back again."
12/05/2021,MeghanM,5.0,Pricy but definitely worth it - the food was amazing
12/05/2021,PatrickT,5.0,"Service was outstanding.  It was our Anniversary and we were treated very special. We requested a booth and although it was a busy Saturday night, were accomadated.  
Both Halibut and Filet were cooked and prepared perfectly."
12/04/2021,Nicole,5.0,Excellent!!! From start to finish....would recommend to anyone. Prices are high but the quality was exceptional.
12/04/2021,Jo1315,5.0,"Every single thing was delicious! For appetizers don't skip the Garlic Bread and Shishito Peppers, you will be sorry if you do! I tried the Seafood Stuffed Lobster and it was FILLED with meat, such a great dish! Lastly, DO NOT skip the Grilled Corn Off The Cob, it's incredibly flavorful, just DELICIOUS!!!!!"
12/03/2021,PaulB,5.0,Our steaks and sides were amazing. Service was amazing but not a quiet dinner… too loud for my mother.
12/02/2021,ShariR,3.0,Been going here for so many years.....always my favorite....always consistent.   This time however I left not so happy.  the Caesar salad is my favorite....value for the $....well the new chef changed it......raised the price $5 and puts 4 baby romaine hearts on a plate......also changed the recipe for the dressing.  not worth it.
11/30/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Wedding anniversary
11/29/2021,BettiDC,5.0,"It was an  enjoyable dinner with my friend who was celebrating her birthday. The food was excellent, although my friend was hoping the wedge salad was on the menu as we had it in the past, the chopped salad was good."
11/29/2021,luv2eat,5.0,Once again Michael Jordan’s DID NOT disappoint. We always look forward to dining here when we are In Connecticut. We always have there Crab cake. First the STAFF is amazing…extremely professional and always warm and welcoming. They have employees working there over 15 years. The menu has been updated. Start with the Tuna tartare/crab cake/octopus. Share a steak and make sure you get the oyster mushrooms and Brussel sprouts. Plenty of other sides but I was hooked on those two sides. My husband had the Halibut two days in a row. Let’s not forget the bartenders…They made us “my special cocktail” exactly the way I enjoy it! Thank you and looking forward to returning.
11/29/2021,DaleS,5.0,"My wife and I had dinner here after attending a concert. It was our second time and did not disappoint. We had custom cocktails, the Porterhouse for Two, and shared a baked potato. We will be returning I am sure."
11/28/2021,TomC,5.0,"Outstanding all around. Fantastic steak & sides, top-notch service, great atmosphere."
11/28/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Anniversary
11/28/2021,Susie,2.0,"We were looking forward to eating here and were disappointed.   Let's talk food first - The meatballs were quite good.  We also had the crab cake.  It was chock full of crab (which was fantastic) but it was bland.  Both the cake and the sauce needed far more seasoning.  The sauce almost seemed like it was just mayonnaise too.  Certainly nothing special and it could have been.  And we should have asked the price (it said MP on the menu) because when the bill came, the crab cake was $40 which to us, was way overpriced.  My husband's meal was ok but certainly nothing to write home about when it came to the filet.  And that was disappointing because this is a steakhouse.  My salmon was very good but it came with arugula and pomegranates which I like but they were plopped into the sauce.  Arugula and sauce is not an appetizing combo.  It also came with eggplant which was good but once again, under seasoned. Not much the server can do as this speaks to food preparation and menu combos.  We also got the mashed potatoes and they were not that warm by the time they got to our table along with the meal (but they were delicious).  Regarding the service - our server was very friendly and very attentive.  Only suggestion is to make sure the extra glassware is taken from the table (i.e. when bringing a second glass of wine, take the glass holder of the first wine off the table.  If a guest isn't having wine, remove their wine glass).  That's small so not too big of a deal but since this is a higher end place, just passing along.  The ambience - it is fine/good.  I did like how the tables at least where we were seated are not too close to each other like some restaurants are."
11/28/2021,TracyB,5.0,Never disappointed when we eat here the food and service are amazing
11/28/2021,SalvatoreR,5.0,"Never disappointed when dining here. We can't say enough about the food, service, etc...everything is amazing and we absolutely love it!"
11/28/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Food was great! Steak at the point! Best Medium steak Ive ever eat!
11/28/2021,ErinH,5.0,Always an excellent meal!
11/27/2021,Kathy,4.0,"Don’t waste my time and money with the East beach oysters.  If you open an oyster and there’s barely an oyster In there, don’t serve it  to your patrons.  The sea scallops were excellent along with the creamed spinach."
11/27/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Went to MJs celebrating my fiancees battle with some health issues. Amanda our liaison, and I say that because she was by far better than a waitress and not a server, was absolutely charming, warm, friendly, and catered to us unbelievably. Please be sure she gets this feedback. She was awesome. The ribeye steak was incredibly good, cooked perfectly. Sides were perfect(asparagus, mashed potatoes) and the Garlic Bread with Arethusa Farms blue cheese fondue is absolutely something you can not pass by! Michael Jordan’s restaurant is by far the best dining destination at the Mohegan Sun Casino if not in the state if you are a carnivore!"
11/27/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Our waiter Brian was outstanding he was attentive but did hover he was extremely knowledgeable on the food and especially the wine. We were celebrating our anniversary and they had a very nice booth for us with high padded sides that helped to keep the noise down, the Anniversary card signed by the staff and complimentary champagne toast was a special touch."
11/27/2021,Customer,5.0,"Wonderful experience. Can’t wait to return.  Service fabulous; attentive, super kind & friendly.  Food delish, filet mignon so good, Brussels sprouts awesome-one order enough for 3 ppl.  Garlic bread, dipped in blue cheese was so yummy."
11/26/2021,ChrisL,2.0,"I have been going here for years 
The menu had changed for the worse 
No more pork chop 
the food and presentation is not what it always was
Sorry I cannot recommend until it is improved to the way it was in the past"
11/26/2021,JohnQ,5.0,"Christmas dinner with family.l was fantastic, felt at home with friendly service great food overall fabulous experience. Love the new look."
11/26/2021,LoriP,5.0,"You will pay money for this dinner, but it is always delicious and worth it."
11/25/2021,MarianneW,5.0,"Although I called this restaurant twice to ask whether they were serving a Thanksgiving meal and no one ever called me back, were were in luck. The turkey dinner was delicious."
11/25/2021,JohnL,5.0,"Must get the Cowboy Rib Eye. 
Crab cake is excellent. 
Wish they had turkey dinner on the menu all the time. 

We came by on Thanksgiving to celebrate our daughter's birthday and Thanksgiving of course. We notified MJ's ahead of time and we were greeted with a birthday card signed by the staff. My daughter was slightly embarrassed but we were extremely impressed. 

Our server was great. Service was speedy. We were in and out in less than hour and we're ecstatic about that. 

At the end of the meal, a brownie sundae with a lit candle was brought to our table to help celebrate my daughter's birthday. 

MJ's was awesome. I'll be sure to come back again. Thank you."
11/24/2021,mike,5.0,"Excellent food and service as usual. Great steak!,"
11/24/2021,TomR,3.0,"I got the 45 dry aged prime Delmonic.  Steak was dry, seemed to be maybe previously frozen or something.  Asked for medium rare, but was more like medium.  It wasn’t juicy and it wasn’t “melt in your mouth”..just lacking..no other way to put it."
11/22/2021,KenS,5.0,"We really enjoyed our dinner and the entire experience.  Food was very good as was the service. We enjoyed the garlic bread with a shared Ceasars Salad, a small tenderloin and a NY Strip and a shared bake potatoe. Too much food, but we managed.  We even shared a carrot cake....which really was more like a spice cake.  All and all we would certainly recommend!!!"
11/21/2021,NancyS,2.0,"We were so looking forward to our return trip to Michael Jordan’s.
Been here many times.
The menu has changed somewhat as has the decor, our server was great but our $120 porterhouse was way over cooked the Garlic Bread was cold
Salads changed too give it a 2 star mushrooms different and cooked terribly.
So disappointed"
11/21/2021,DEBS,3.0,"Pricy for the quantity of food.  Filet mignon appeared to be 5 oz instead of 7 oz. Potato overcooked.  At $100 per person with tip, a diner expects more.  Just food for thought."
11/21/2021,DKNYLI,5.0,Really had a fantastic meal. Julia our waitress was awesome and a great sport. Crab cake was expensive but absolutely outstanding. Big crowd but overall smooth experience. No complaints at all.
11/20/2021,JoanneP,5.0,"Allison the waitress was spot on. The steak, potatoes, bread and wine fabulous. Brussel sprouts flavor full, but tuff and chewy on many of them."
11/20/2021,TammyT,4.0,"My husbands steak was perfect, mine was way overcooked.  We had an awesome waitress"
11/20/2021,Steve,3.0,For what’s at casino it’s ok but prices high for okay food and lots of rowdy gamblers
11/19/2021,NickW,5.0,"Had all the oysters, crab cake, and tuna tartar for appetizers. All were great. Crab cake was best I ever had. Shared the mvp option with my group. Fantastic. Tried each dessert. Amazing display and taste!"
11/18/2021,williamg,5.0,Best steak I have had in a very long time -45 day aged delmonico - ordered the suave that comes with Waygu - Brussels sprouts and fries - incredible meal thanks
11/16/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Our previous experiences were so so good.  Our favorite place.  This time was good but not as before.  We will definitely come back.  The service by Melissa was impeccable.
11/14/2021,KKGG,3.0,I’ve been to this restaurant many times. I usually love it. This time the service was very sub par.
11/14/2021,vman465,5.0,Michael Jordan's as always is great. But now they dramatically increased their prices on pretty much all the item on their menu. The Crab cake use to be $20. Now it's $40. Insane!
11/14/2021,kd2000,5.0,"One of my all-time favorite restaurants.  The food, the service, and the location are hard to beat.  They have a fantastic wine list, the steaks are always cooked flawlessly, and the garlic bread with warm blue cheese fondue over is required (well, t
It should be)."
11/14/2021,YumQuest,5.0,"Never disappointed from the host/ess staff to the wait staff they aim to please and make it the most enjoyable experience. The food is always done perfectly, even when super busy... family of 6 celebrating a few things and we had the best time. Great cocktails, delicious food and a server who added to the enjoyment. We will be back soon!"

11/13/2021,ALLISONM,5.0,"When I made my reservation, I put in a special request.  To show my request was acknowledged, we received a glass of champagne.  Started the dinner off perfectly."
11/12/2021,Kristine,5.0,"The food was amazing and service excellent. I only had one complaint, it was quite dark inside. The table next to us used their cell phones for a long time looking over menu and ordering. It was absolutely blinding us. I felt the manager should have addressed this. Otherwise, food and service amazing!!"
11/12/2021,MichelleT,1.0,"Such a terrible experience. We really thought that we were choosing the best place for my husbands birthday. 
Needles to say they didn’t even put a candle in the cake. Just came and placed it on the table. My son (3 years old) wanted a cheeseburger from the Michael Jordan sports bar next door and they said they wouldn’t let him eat it in their restaurant. My server flat out said no and then said he would ask a manager. I even offered to buy a full adult entree for him, if the problem was that they felt they were loosing out on the money. 
Only when I said I was closing my bill out and leaving (at this point only drinks had been ordered) did the manager come out and say that they would accommodate and they even brought the burger over themselves. At this point my head was spinning, and my three year old was crying from confusion and hunger. 

The only good thing that happened was that my husband actually enjoyed the steak he ordered. My mothers meal was so salty that she couldn’t eat it. My stuffed lobster was okay, but cold. And my son did enjoy his burger finally. We all wished we had gone to the sports bar instead when we saw his burger. 🙂

Would never put my kids in this situation ever again."
11/12/2021,Steve,5.0,"Absolutely amazing food and service, from the appetizers to entrees to the side, best meal I’ve had"
11/11/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Absolutely love this place. Slam dunk (see what I did there?), every time. It’s been ages since I had been back and it was exactly as I remember it. Flawless experience. Thank you Melissa & Angel for an amazing birthday dinner!"

Ambiance was wonderful!
Will definitely be back!"
11/11/2021,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Very good .. Love the garlic bread our server was awesome one hiccup but was corrected right away
11/11/2021,DianeM,5.0,Steak entree's excellent - but so are the other options such as their chicken and shrimp dishes[
11/10/2021,PaulP,5.0,"Everything about this restaurant was amazing. Our server Kate was awesome and took very good care of us.
I would recommend this restaurant 100%"
11/08/2021,KatieT,5.0,"AMAZING!!!  We tried the steaksmanship series and it was amazing!  Best steaks I have had in a long time.  Service was perfect, atmosphere was perfect, drinks where perfect, everything was perfect!"
11/08/2021,BigJohn,5.0,"Really happy with our experience here!  Waitstaff was friendly, courteous, and on point with timing/accuracy/etc.  That's not always the case especially with COVID staffing challenges but these guys were excellent!  The somm was very helpful and I didn't feel I was upsold on wine my palate can't appreciate.  We ate like pigs headed to the slaughter.  Shrimp cocktail were huge and fresh.  The Nueske's double smoked bacon is insanely good; next time I'll ask for it to come with the steak instead of as an app but it's one of those flavors you cannot get out of your mind for all the right reasons.  The Caesar salad was fresh and a good attempt to be ""healthy"" between our 2 gluttonous courses.  The Mrs had the filet (cooked perfectly) and I the scallops (incredible sides on the plate), so a nice little surf&turf when the sharing begins.  The creamed spinach was lights out - toe to toe with any high end steakhouse offering.  We will be back and can't wait to explore the rest of the menu."
11/08/2021,RichardT,4.0,"Staff was very accommodating 
Food was out quickly"
11/07/2021,SSGG,5.0,Our waiter was extremely considerate.  We were a group of 4 and 2 had show tickets.  He accommodated our need to get two in/out within an hour and he did this without making us feel rushed.  Great meal - it is always a pleasure to dine with you.  We LOVE the newly renovated space.  Nice job!
11/07/2021,MichaelR,5.0,"Michael Jordan's Restaurant is just simply the best! You are definitely getting your money's worth, inclusive of the outrageously delicious food to the fantastic service."

He made us feel welcome with his big smile and as busy as he was he made the time to chat to make sure all was good"
11/07/2021,Sista,5.0,Absolutely  delicious Fiket Mignon and asparagus and mashed potatoes. Cocktails were so good and Garlic bread to die for. Chocolate cake decadent.Service was excellent! 5 star experience.

11/07/2021,Thomas,3.0,"My wife and I visited the restaurant on 11/7 to celebrate our 41 year anniversary.
We did so to experience the reputation for serving the best steaks. The staff and service was outstanding. However, my steak was difficult cutting and generally tough. The pricing should reflect the quality of the product. This was not the case here. I had decided leave a message on the restaurant website. Unfortunately, the contact link does not work so I am posting here. We were truly disappointed."
11/07/2021,RobinT,5.0,Fabulous service! Food is wonderful but be prepared to pay. If you don't mind paying for excellence this is the place to dine!
11/07/2021,SalvatoreR,5.0,"Food was amazing. Our server Robert went above and beyond to make our experience over the top! Little bit noisy but it was a Saturday night at the casino so it was expected. Overall, a great place!"
11/07/2021,DavidL,5.0,Everything was excellent!!! Made our 13th Wedding Anniversary a memorable one!!!
11/06/2021,ANTONIOV,5.0,"Great food, great service, friendly staff. Best to make reservations if going on the weekend."
11/06/2021,KellieN,5.0,Fabulous food and service! Would definitely go again and recommend this restaurant
11/06/2021,Catlover1957,5.0,Fabulous dinner. Great service. Consistently great steaks.
11/06/2021,Mike,4.0,"Apps: Garlic bread was great. Unique presentation with blue cheese dipping. Caeser salad was very disappointing. Not much of it and little flavor. Avoid that salad.

Entrees: Filet for me, asked for medium and received well done. Still edible, but not great. My wife had scallops and loved them.

Service: Great. Waitress was friendly and attentive. Great with refilling drinks without  having to ask.

Ambiance: Really loud, which doesn't typically bother me. One large party nearby had a loudmouth that could probably be heard from across the street. Not the restaurants fault. 

Overall: Good, but not great. Worth trying and I would go back again if I was in town, but not a priority as there are many restaurants in MS."
11/06/2021,AlanC,5.0,Awesome!!  Great meal all around. Started with the garlic bread and a chopped salad followed up with the fillet with Mac & cheese and mushrooms. All amazing. Have not been to this place in about 15 years and like a fine wine improved age. Did I say Awesome?!!?! Just go there.
11/06/2021,JohnR,4.0,Great good bit very expensive
11/05/2021,ANTHONYP,5.0,Wife and mine  date nite
11/05/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Went for my husbands birthday with another couple and the 4 of us had the best meals ever!! Everything was absolutely delicious!! We will be back
11/05/2021,MeganB,5.0,Everything at Michael Jordan’s Steakhouse was amazing! From the moment we walked in the service was nothing like I have experienced! The food was so fresh and absolutely delicious.
11/05/2021,LeaL,5.0,T bone steak and trio of mashed potatoes was outstanding. Service was excellent - our server was friendly and helpful. Definitely an electric energy
11/05/2021,BRIANS,5.0,This Was Our 8th Trip To Mj’s As Great As It Was The 1st Time.. My Wife And I Get The 10ounce Filets And It Was Perfect! We’ll Be Back Soon. Thanks MJ’s!
11/05/2021,ColleenG,4.0,"I know MJ’s is popular and busy, I get that. Next time, when my husband and I order a martini, we want to be able to sit and enjoy our drinks together, without someone hovering over us asking if we are ready for our main meal. We received our martinis and within two minutes, our appetizers were on the table. We were still enjoying our appetizer and martinis, the waitress kept coming up and asking if we were ready for our dinner order. Once we had our meals on the table, our dinner was great. But it is so “rush rush” to get people seated, drinking and eating and to get us out of there. If I am spending $400 on my and my spouses’ meal, I don’t want to be rushed out within 45 minutes like our presence is an inconvenience. Especially if I have to make our dinner reservation two weeks in advance. MJ’s is always the best of the best, but they can’t expect people to place their whole dinner order within 10 minutes of sitting down."
11/05/2021,Allison,5.0,"Always our favorite restaurant when we visit Mohegan Sun. The service was impeccable (shoutout to Brian and Ryan) and the food was phenomenal. We highly recommend the crab cake appetizer (all crab, no filler), the 16oz Delmonico steak, and the 23 layer chocolate cake."
11/05/2021,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Great atmosphere, great service, really good food (although the steak I had could’ve used a little salt.) I was a little disappointed with the amount of wine they poured.  I ordered a glass of Cab for 15-16 bucks and I barely got 5 ounces."
11/04/2021,scott,4.0,Highly Recommended. Always great food and service.
11/04/2021,Diversefid,3.0,"Just too expensive. Been here many times, but I think I won't be going as often. Steaks are very good, but sides are $15+, steaks are $55+ and just not worth the money. The octopus app was good, a little saucy though. Service was a bit slow, the bread came late and they need to get more creative with cocktail menu. Decent wine list, but again, our tab was $260 before tip, for 2 people, 3 drinks total, one app and one side. 2 filets, one was ""crusted"" with blue cheese, but the crust was more like mush."
11/01/2021,JeffreyB,3.0,"Food was cooked well as specified, prices were high but expected."
10/31/2021,OpenTable Diner,2.0,We have enjoyed dining at Michael Jordan steakhouse in the past. Our most recent experience was not that great. The food was not up to the usual standards.
10/31/2021,ARSNV2015,5.0,My wife and I celebrated our anniversary at the restaurant. It has been a yearly tradition for the last 6 years and the staff never disappoints. We received congratulations from every staff member that we came in contact with. The food and service was fantastic as always. We recommend the restaurant to all of our friends and family.
10/31/2021,JackieV,5.0,Everything was amazing! From our seafood platter appetizer to the Wagyu steak cooked to perfection to the baked Alaska to complete the meal. Service was great - Shout out to Tanya and Logan for taking care of us!
10/30/2021,LbrownH,3.0,Nice meal in a very busy casino!  Enjoyed our meal
10/30/2021,JenniferK,5.0,Delicious! Best steak my husband ever had. I had the lamb and it was amazing.

10/30/2021,JohnK,5.0,The food was excellent the Delmonico steak was one of the best I have ever had appetizers were great can’t wait to go back my wife’s filet minion was cooked to perfection omg
10/29/2021,ChristopherB,5.0,"Really great food... a little on the pricey side but top of the line quality.  Great atmosphere, but on a busy Friday night the restaurant was very loud and it was a little difficult to hold a conversation without speaking up."
10/28/2021,Rump,5.0,Excellent meal and service  Made for an enjoyable evening
10/28/2021,ChrisG,3.0,For 2 people and $300 it should have been better. It was just ok.

I found the menu to be a bit limited."
10/17/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The service was impeccable. Dallas the manager is such an asset. He makes  you comfortable from the moment you step thru the door. Food is superb and the new atmosphere is cozy yet classic
10/17/2021,NickF,5.0,Loved our experience.  We were treated wonderfully and our server Danielle was amazing.  Huge thumbs up for our anniversary dinner
10/17/2021,SharonH,5.0,Anniversary
10/17/2021,Alvarorod83,5.0,Our server and waiter Brian (Yes they both had the same name) were great and knowledgeable. Couldn't have had a better experience. Plenty of leftovers too for our late night hotel room snack!! Love this place.
10/16/2021,JaclynL,5.0,I love this place! The food is delicious! I got the garlic bread and Mac and cheese and it was amazinggg!! The ambiance was beautiful and the waitress was really great. I will be coming back again soon!
10/16/2021,TimothyF,4.0,Absolutely fantastic meal-steaks we’re worth every penny! Service was very good!
10/16/2021,Moe7,5.0,We really enjoyed our Anniversary dinner here. The service and atmosphere was great and the Ribeye was the best I ever had. We will be back!
10/16/2021,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Bacon was meh. Corn off cob was disgusting flavors. Crab cakes insanely overpriced.  Garlic bread the highlight as always and mushrooms as well.
10/16/2021,henryc,4.0,"would have liked smaller portion for less money! steak should have been medium well,    but no color at all. steak was still good, but cant compare to ruths chris."
10/15/2021,patc,3.0,"My husbands steak and potato was good , I had the throw back steak.. the potatoes were grainy, the cheese on top was burnt and over all the dish was salty.  We had the garlic bread which we love and that was also burnt on the edges, however the sauce was as great as always. We never received bread for the table, dinner felt rushed and forgotten. 

Service was poor, my husband never received his water, the runner cleared out appetizer dishes and took our clean forks but left our dirty ones we had set aside with our dirty dishes. We waited 20 minutes for our waiter to return after he dropped off dessert menus. Needless to say we just asked for our check, that of course came in record time. 

3rd time we have had dinner there, the first two were memorable. We will stick to going to the sports bar next door or the mexican restaurant down stairs. Better service and food is wonderful"
10/15/2021,scaper,5.0,Awesome garlic bread. Well everythings awesome but the garlic bread is really awesome. Try the garlic bread.  Its awesome.
10/15/2021,Natni,5.0,Great food and service!! Highly recommend

10/15/2021,NickD,5.0,Great food and service.
10/13/2021,BradS,4.0,We arrived on time and were seated promptly but got a lousy table location. I asked to move but was told it was not possible. We were very close to main kitchen entrance and we were constantly distracted by the never ending parade of servers hustling in and out of the kitchen while barking orders to and fro. The carpaccio was delicious and the filets were cooked to med-rare perfection. Normally we would stay for desert and a glass of port but on this occasion we did not to avoid sitting on the edge of the runway any longer.
10/13/2021,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Incredibly disappointed with the new menu.  Some of the items were downright bad.  Very bad.  The staff is pretty upset no one is listening to them and they are losing money due to the horrible changes in the menu.
10/10/2021,JohnL,5.0,"My wife had the most memorable birthday dinner EVER!  She was so happy, and that make me happy.  Of course, I enjoyed EVERYTHING about Michael Jordan steakhouse too!!  Most highly recommend to everyone!"
10/10/2021,CarlosO,5.0,"Sara was outstanding waitress, helpful, attentive."
10/10/2021,Marg,5.0,"Dinner was absolutely fabulous.  Although we wanted an evening reservation, the only one we could get was Sunday at 3:45pm. However, the ambience in the restaurant made it appear to be much later in the afternoon/evening, tricking our body’s  circadian rhythms! Our servers were fabulous, spending  lots of time explaining all of our options! Since it was our first time at this restaurant, maybe it was a good thing that we went early because our servers had more time to devote to our inquiries.  Food was scrumptious, cooked to order and brought out in a timely manner. We had a rather traditional dinner of Caesar salad, filet  mignon, mashed potatoes( The order comes with three different varieties, one better than the next), and creamed spinach. Can’t really think of one negative issue, except for the fact that it was quite pricey, as all outstanding steak houses are!!!  I hope you are as fortunate to have as great an experience  as we had!!!    Oh, by the way, we were celebrating my friends birthday and they brought out a complementary brownie and ice cream dessert... very delicious and well-appreciated!"
10/10/2021,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Took forever to be seated. The hostess was extremely rude. Will not be back.
10/09/2021,EricD,5.0,"Great experience as always!
Food was excellent as always! 
Still the best steak I have ever had!"

10/08/2021,LouD,5.0,"celerbrated my daughters birthdays, food was terific service outstanding always great no matter when you go"
10/08/2021,BobI,1.0,"Worst meal ever. 
Ate about 4ounces of a 20oz stead. 
20oz aged steak was burnt so bad I  couldn’t cut through it. 
Lobster was dry and shelled claw was full of cartilage. 
My wife’s swordfish was burnt and dry. 
Waiter never asked how our meal was. Pretty sure he could see it looked terrible. 
I have eaten at David Burke’s on a regular basis and this was my first time at Michael Jordan’s. 
I will never go back there again. Food and service deserve 0 stars."
10/07/2021,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Very friendly
10/07/2021,LeslieM,5.0,"Our meal was delicious. Cowboy rib eye was cooked to perfection! Our waiter was the best, so personable and was so kind to bring us 2 glasses of champagne and a dessert to celebrate my husband’s birthday. Would highly recommend going to MJ!"

10/07/2021,LiberalMinded,4.0,First time here. Food was good  Service was excellent. I was expecting more though for the prices and ala cart menu.
10/07/2021,jeffreyk,2.0,Difficult to make a reservation yet restaurant was almost empty.  Hostess not friendly
10/07/2021,Heavenslight,4.0,"Food is good, service is good, prices however are way off.  The food is good, just over priced, like way over priced.  Just for a 7oz filet mignon is $58.  It was good but not good enough to justify that price.  Also, the restaurant was loud.  So loud that I could not hear my friend sitting right next to me.  A salad was $18,  a salad!  Well, u get the idea. If u like paying way too much for food, enjoy!"
10/06/2021,HollyB,3.0,Way too expensive and I don't mind paying for good food but $50 - $70 for a steak is ridiculous. And you don't even get any sides with it. Wouldn't go back. Too dark too - mood lighting is great but it was like eating with a blindfold on.
10/03/2021,Outstanding,5.0,Food and service were outstanding
10/03/2021,DominicS,5.0,The food was flavorful and the portions were not lacking. Steaks were tender and seasoned nicely. Crab cake was tender and the sauce was light and fresh. The only downside was the wait one of my party members had trying to get a glass of wine at the bar.
10/03/2021,AlbiV,5.0,"First time there, will absolutely be back! Everything was delicious and our server was excellent and friendly."
10/03/2021,TyrrellB,5.0,Great food and drink but very noisy
10/03/2021,Rachel,5.0,"We came here for our anniversary dinner. The hostess said happy anniversary when we arrived, we were given an anniversary card and then champagne when our dessert came. 10/10 would recommend for celebrating any special occasion or just a night out."

10/02/2021,Lizzy,5.0,"We had a tough night, bc StubHub never emailed us our Sebastian Maniscalco tickets. Our waitress was beyond kind & generous. We were celebrating my husbands belated birthday from COVID & she brought us champagne & a delicious brownie dessert with a candle. We were so touched! Thank you!"
10/02/2021,sicamore,5.0,We ordered the porterhouse for two and it was one of the best steaks I've ever had.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant as great option for dinner at the casino.
10/02/2021,Leeb331,5.0,"Staff was wonderful.  Our table was ready when we arrive, no need to wait, yes we had a reservation but still didnt have to wait. Just like to give a shout out to Ryan.  He was very attentive to our table and gave us hes undivided attention"

10/02/2021,YumQuest,5.0,"The food did not disappoint and the service was stellar. Our server could not have been better - great recommendations,  went out of her way to get the beer my husband drinks,  attentive without being smothering or disruptive and very, very pleasant. The food was perfectly cooked,  fresh and hot/ cold and very tasty.  4 for ambience as we were seated at a hard chair table next to a big group instead of a nice private banquette booth. Can't wait to come back."
10/02/2021,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Used to be my favorite spot. Been a few years since I had been there. Revamped menu not too fond of. Steak quality definitely not what it was in the past, which was phenomenal. Maybe an off night perhaps? Will give it another try, but if next time is like yesterday, wouldn’t go out of my way to go back again. Hope they make some changes/tweaks and get back to the way things were."
10/01/2021,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"This place was wonderful. The food is amazing, the ambiance is perfect. The place is super loud though and very much packed with people. We had the garlic bread fondu and this was the most flavorful appetizer on the menu. Blue cheese fondu was out of this world.  It did take about 20 mins to seat but our waitress did get our food in quickly as we had a comedy show 45 minutes after we ate. Wonderful dining experience and we will definitely return. Thank you!!"
10/01/2021,StevenL,5.0,"My wife and I have been to MJ's many times - it's our go to when we visit Mohegan!!!  The food is always amazing!  The service is top notch!  This time we had Simone, one of our favorite servers at any restaurant of all time!!!  Thank you for another great experience!  We will be back soon:)"
10/01/2021,SEF4215,2.0,"Extremely loud.  Could not hold conversation.  Steak not tender, nor flavorful. Very disappointing.  Quality of steak comparable to supermarket steak.  Did not let us know the al la carte sides are more than enough for 2 people.  So most of sides were not eaten.   Expectations high for this restaurant, but they fell short.  Sorry we chose Michael Jordan Steakhouse"
10/01/2021,JohnF,5.0,"It was a special occasion and the Hostess and maitre de were outstanding. 
The wait staff was very attentive and the food was first class. If I didn’t live in FL. I would be there weekly."
09/29/2021,CherylT,5.0,"Enjoyed a wonderful anniversary dinner.  The porterhouse for two was delicious and cooked to perfection.  The signature garlic bread was delightful, as always, and the celebratory slice of house-made key lime pie was to die for!  Nikki, our server was so very personable, informative and attentive.  5 star experience!"

09/25/2021,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Dinner and service were excellent, however, they’ve changed the menu and removed or changed some favorites. The wedge salad has been removed and the filet now has a tomato butter sauce. Why change something that worked?!"

09/24/2021,Steven,5.0,Well worth the 2 Hour drive to feast on their delicious steak!
09/23/2021,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Service was not great. Seating accommodation was by the entrance and was busy and noisy. Food was great as usual. Definitely sub par for them this time out
09/22/2021,harrisk,5.0,"Walked in. No wait. Had reservations. Great table location. Attentive staff all the around. Food was perfect from entrees to dessert and wine.

09/22/2021,WarrenO,4.0,Service was really good the fillet was excellent definitely worth the money
09/20/2021,MikeD,5.0,We went for our anniversary everything was spectacular
09/20/2021,LauraD,5.0,Absolutely outstanding! Food and service were impeccable.
09/20/2021,Tico,1.0,Way way way overpriced. A 7 ounce filet sitting alone on a very large plate is ridiculous even if it was cooked perfectly. Tales and chairs very uncomfortable and tables for two way too small. I hope the millionaire Michael Jordon did not make much money on our meal.
09/20/2021,JeffG,4.0,"It’s been quite a while since I have been in a michael Jordan steakhouse and I got the same thing as I got in the past. Good not great. When you pay $100 for a porterhouse you expect it to be great but you are not going to get that at Michael’s. It’s decent and we had a nice dinner but there are just so many better steakhouses for that money that unless you can’t get in elsewhere where you are, can’t really recommend it"
09/19/2021,GlenS,5.0,Excellent service. Excellent food. The Porterhouse foe two was perfectly done. More than we could handle.
09/19/2021,LongIsland1,3.0,"They have totally redone the inside of this restaurant.  It’s very nice looking to the eye.   However, they also redid the menu and took away some of our favorites - like the wedge salad, fresh clams, and various entrees.  In addition, we had 7:00 reservations and they were already out of one of the menu items (steak frites) that we wanted to try.   As a result, our rating from the last time we visited in June (pre-changes) was a 5 star rating but this time it is more of a 3 star rating.   The 3 star rating is heavily influenced by the amazing service we received from Danielle - she was amazing and made our overall experience enjoyable.   Not sure we will be back on such a regular basis in the future due to the changes.  I will say, our appetizers and drinks were excellent and our filet mignon was cooked perfectly, however, our half stuffed  lobster ($65) was not exactly worth the price as it was more of a creamy sauce and there is calamari in the stuffing which added a texture we did not enjoy."
09/19/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Was our first time there. Loved everything about it
09/19/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,As always the best !!!

09/18/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We sat at the bar as we were 10 minutes late and didn’t want to wait but it was great!
09/18/2021,RandyA,3.0,"Love the restaurant,we have been going for years, but after the remodel they also let the new chef change the menu, and I did not like it, lack of flavor and in properly prepared,my son had to send his steak back 3 times to make it mid rare and it was still under done."
09/18/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Super attentive and helpful staff.
09/18/2021,DeborahG,5.0,First time going there and it was amazing !!! Food was so good delicious ! Every plate we ordered was outstanding. It was also my boyfriend birthday and he was treated great!

09/17/2021,Samantha,5.0,"Went for dinner before a concert for our anniversary. Staff was amazingly attentive. Food was perfectly done. Ambience is upscale with an elegant touch. We got a champagne toast is celebration of our anniversary. If you're at Mohegan, you have to eat here!"
09/16/2021,Kpbg,4.0,"Brian was our server and he was wonderful. The ambiance was lovely. Cocktails and wine were great. My chicken was excellent -flavorful and juicy-loved the sides.  My husband had Steak Delmonico and his friend had the Filet Mignon.  Though prepared correctly, both said that the meat was not the quality they had previously enjoyed at MJ. The sides of mashed potatoes, creamed spinach and mushrooms ranged from okay to fine- not great. Disappointing and will try other places next time."
09/16/2021,TraceyM,5.0,Phenomenal food!!! Best steak I’ve ever had as well as everything else.  Service was good as well.
09/16/2021,lindan,5.0,It was our anniversary dinner. I hadn't been to a restaurant in over a year. Everything from the staff to the food was excellent. Staff all had masks on and were very attentive. Food was excellent. A little pricey but you got a fair amount of food on your plate. We even got free glasses of champagne and an anniversary card signed by the staff. I would definitely go back.
09/16/2021,NicoleZ,3.0,"Steaks were fantastic, Garlic bread beat ever……all the sides were gross and a waste of time"
09/16/2021,MarianQ,5.0,The food and the service was GREAT! Carlos and Chris waited on us and made us feel like we were in their home.  We will be coming back !

09/13/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The food was excellent... taste, temperature, portion and presentation were great! Pretty pricey and everything is a la cart so won't be going often. My partner and I ordered the porterhouse for 2, trio mashed potatoes,  oysters, blue cheese fondue and bread as well as 1 crab cake. DELICIOUS! The steak was perfectly cooked - medium with a nice char."

09/10/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Celebrated our Anniversary. Had a wonderful meal. The staff signed a card for us & gave us complimentary champagne!
09/10/2021,KyleK,5.0,Priced on the higher end so not your everyday date night but worth every penny. The food and service were top notch. I would pay the same for smaller portions as they give you so much we could take advantage of the delicious looking deserts. We will definitely return and bring friends.
09/09/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great staff
09/09/2021,markw,5.0,"Was great food, ambience a little dark but I liked the new make over."
09/09/2021,Amyjo,3.0,Very loud and very expensive. Everything is ala carte. Service was excellent and the food was ok.  But it cost $200 for two with only one glass of wine and without dessert.
09/05/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We had the best time for our anniversary! Service and food was amazing and we can’t wait to come back!
09/02/2021,LauraD,4.0,The food and service was absolutely wonderful.  The noise level was awful.   They need to have a quiet area.  Otherwise it was great
09/01/2021,None,5.0,21st birthday - party of 7. Waitress was super nice. Everything was great!

09/01/2021,JeffR,5.0,As usual the service was excellent and the steaks were great.
08/29/2021,MzDisney,5.0,"My husband and I share the same exact birthday, so we wanted to go somewhere special to celebrate. MJ’s turned out to be the perfect spot!  When we arrived, we were shown to our beautiful, romantic booth, each given a birthday card signed by MJ and the entire staff, as well as a toast of Prosecco. Very nice!  Everything we ordered was cooked to perfection. The filet mignon just melted in your mouth. Because it was our birthday's, we each got to choose a dessert from the menu. I chose the Carrot Cake, which had 4 layers to it, and hubby chose his favorite dessert, which he can never find anywhere, Baked Alaska!  We accompanied those with a tea and cappuccino and all was well. 

Thank you so much MJ’s, for giving us one of the best birthday meals we will never forget!!"
08/29/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Michael Jordan's is an awesome restaurant!  The food is outstanding and the service, even given the shortage of wait staff was great!"
08/29/2021,Cornellmama,5.0,Never disappointed by quality of the food and service
08/29/2021,Junie,5.0,The atmosphere was very nice. Enjoy the new bar very much. Food was perfect as was service.
08/29/2021,Barbarab,2.0,The new menu was disappointed as too many add on no quality the portion were okay but thought for what we ate was not at all filling
08/29/2021,SarahJ,2.0,"Our waitress was amazing, the food was terrible. Do not order the Michael Jordan Crush (I think thats what its called) it was awful and tasted like medicine. Again the waitress was great but we will not be returning."
08/29/2021,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Appetizer, Entre, Drinks and service were all very good. Desserts were not good but all together, a good meal."
08/29/2021,DianneD,1.0,Noisy. Tables are small. Dishes too small to cut steak.  Steak Knives didn't cut. Medium steak was burnt. 3 hours to eat. Took 45 min to seat us. We had a reservation! Wouldn't recommend. Overpriced for the meal. Had better. Steak wasn't great quality.
08/28/2021,MoodyFoodie,5.0,The new menu was fabulous and the service was amazing! We had family visiting and they said it was the best meal they have had here. Thank you!
08/28/2021,Kathy,5.0,"Hi Dallas! Kathy Hagist  Thank you for being so gracious as to come to our table and speak with us! We also thank you for the complimentary 23 layer cake! It was delicious as always! I was so happy to hear the waitress say you were still with the restaurant. When I said ""playoffs"" you were sensitive enough not to correct me. You being a part of the experience made it DELIGHTFUL!!!!! 

Thank you, Kathy"
08/28/2021,LauraC,5.0,Service was outstanding. Especially liked the sampler of steaks. The wine list had some great picks
08/28/2021,Emine,5.0,Exceptional service and great food! Drinks were made perfectly and the waiter was a sweetheart!
08/28/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Best steak I have ever had! Everything we ordered was great.
08/27/2021,TaraV,2.0,"This used to be my favorite place to eat at Mohegan. Sadly, not anymore. New chef. Those delicious rolls are gone, as are the lobster mashed potatoes, which I would always look forward to. We ordered the $16 meatballs, but they were overcooked. Our waitress was great and apologized (not that it was her fault). She even sent over some garlic bread, which is not my thing, but I have heard is very good. My husband wasn't impressed. The filet was cooked well, but I didn't like the new tomato butter. I also didn't like the pesto butter that came with the new rolls. I get that a new chef might want to add new menu items, but that place got such rave reviews for their food. Why mess with the items that people love? I would always recommend it when people asked where to eat. I mentioned my experience on FB and 4 people agreed with me right away that it has gone downhill. Again, I can't stress enough that our waitress was wonderful and the food runner asked what we thought of the food as well. Unfortunately, the food quality and options are not on the level they used to be."
08/27/2021,Annaf,5.0,"Good food,good service,have been a few times and will continue to visit"
08/27/2021,Momloveswine,2.0,"Very dark and neutral. Nothing to enjoy looking at. Food left much to be desired and for the price,  not worth trying again. Disappointing as we were looking forward this evening."
08/27/2021,Epicurean45,4.0,"After the renovation, the menu has changed. Some of the favorites (Lobster Bisque, for example) are gone as MJ's Steakhouse moves toward the trend of smaller plates and variety.

The steaks (NY Strips) were okay - not the best cuts of sirloin and a bit chewy. I would highly recommend cutting back the salt in the marinade or rub that they use as it is a bit overwhelming. Flavor was decent once you get past the salty seasoning.

Service was exceptional. Very friendly hostess and extremely helpful and efficient waitress and assistant. This will go far in bringing me back to MJ's."
08/27/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"My husband and I were celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary. I had mentioned it was an anniversary dinner when I made the reservation and as soon as our waitress came over, she wished us a happy anniversary. Then she brought us each a complimentary glass of champagne! The good was outstanding as well."
08/26/2021,steveW,2.0,"Started amazing as I was celebrating and a complimentary wine .Service from waitress was 5 star, we waited Wine came out, an hour for salad, as computer mistake. then waited. Steak came out no sides. waited then told no baked potatoes tonight . So ate steak , Great steak ,then an assortment of potatoes came out.
Dessert was ordered great !! 
Service was great. The waitress was in a terrible spot, but handled it great.
Manager apologized for the problem. All restaurants have a bad day.

Maybe will be back if the server is there. *****"
08/25/2021,EllenA,5.0,"We dined last night at the newly renovated Michael Jordan’s. Frankly we don’t see much of a difference and it is darker in there now. Service was stellar-Kate was our server and took good care if us. I preferred the old menu- I liked the Lamb Chops and how they were prepared. I did not order them last night as the description of the seasoning was not to my taste. I had the short rib pasta which was in a heavy cream sauce - not great. My husband and friend ordered the Porterhouse for 2- they were thrilled with it. Sides are always good as is the wine. Frankly, I liked it better before. Next time we will probably eat next door at the MJ Cafe."
08/25/2021,RitaM,5.0,Food and service were amazing.  Staff supportive providing information on dishes to be split between couples due to size.  Depleted plates removed and water filled quickly.  This is a pricey restaurant but the quality and excellence of food explains that and is worth it!!!
08/25/2021,sharonp,4.0,Great food.  Waitstaff excellent!  Nice place for date night.
08/22/2021,JoyM,5.0,"Sad to hear our favorite waiter was leaving. Other than that, we had an amazing time with amazing service!"
08/22/2021,BenjyZ,5.0,Is doing great no need criticism from me i love the place
08/21/2021,EliseS,4.0,"We've eaten at Michael Jordan's many times and this is the first time we were disappointed. Not a major disappointment, but we didn't feel it was great as in times past. The server said they're only recently reopened after some renovations, so there were no specials on the menu. They also removed the Kansas City steak from the menu which was a big disappointment to my husband. While the renovations did make the place look bigger, they seem to have taken away whatever helped mute the noise level--it was very loud and hard to have a conversation. Our food was good for the most part, steaks were cooked to the correct temperature, but my husband's steak was so salty, he left half of it, which has never happened before. We mentioned it to two of our servers, who said they would let the chef know, but in the past someone would've come by to further investigate/apologize for that, but no one seemed to really care. We still enjoyed our dinner but it was disappointing by previous standards. We actually had canceled reservations at Tao to go there when we heard MJ's had reopened and were sorry afterward that we hadn't tried Tao instead."
08/21/2021,Rocky,5.0,"as usual great dinner at a great place and great people and staff and will definitely be back soon . key lime pie and carrot cake were fantastic. overall PERFECT . 
(CRAB BISQUE ) LOL."
08/21/2021,NicoleM,3.0,"Came to MJ’s to celebrate an anniversary. They gave complimentary champagne which was a nice touch; however, we were not impressed by the food. For apps we had the octopus and crab spring rolls. The octopus was over cooked and the tomatoes/sauce on top tasted like jarred tomatoes. The crab spring rolls were okay, basically tasted like crab Rangoon from a Chinese restaurant. Neither app was worth the price IMO. For dinner I had the seafood stuffed lobster. It was just okay - overall was pretty dry with not much flavor. On the other hand my boyfriend’s steak was phenomenal. The mashed potato trio was decent but two of the three potatoes tasted identical..sub par dinner overall for the price."
08/21/2021,JeffreyS,5.0,"Great atmosphere, excellent service and welcoming staff. Food was beyond amazing!"
08/21/2021,SalF,3.0,"I've been to MJ's many times. Always a great place food and service. They just recently did some remodeling and must of also made some changes in the kitchen. The food this time was somewhat off. I usually get the porterhouse, something was not right with the taste. The corn off the cobb, now is being topped off with sour cream, which completely over takes the corn. Not a good thing. And last but not least, the crembrulee was removed from the menu. Not too happy this timenaround!"
08/20/2021,Danny,5.0,Love the place always great food and service!!!!!!
08/20/2021,BobH,4.0,Food and cocktails were great. Service was outstanding. The restaurant was noisier than I expected but okay for conversation.
08/20/2021,DavidS,5.0,"Just reopened after remodeling. Slightly different menu but same, excellent steaks and chops. Great, friendly service. Highly recommended"
08/20/2021,RichardL,3.0,Steak was great as usual.  Other new menu items not as good.
08/20/2021,OSCAR,5.0,From the reception to the waitress service has been better than great.We have been there several times and your establishment is run as a 5 Star restaurant.The food is great
08/20/2021,JenniferS,5.0,Wish I could give it 10 stars! Delicious food and the service was outstanding.
08/19/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Anniversary
08/19/2021,Nelle,4.0,Very disappointed to learn that the crab cake is no longer available. It has been replaced with a crab spring roll that was more cream cheese than crab meat. They were gracious about it & removed the item from the bill.  The service seemed disjointed at times with lulls in service. The scallop dinner & NY steak were both awesome with the steak being cooked to perfection. I would like to see the lobster tail offered as a dinner vs. an add-on. They need to update the online menu so it accurately reflects the changes.
08/19/2021,danu,5.0,Michael Jordan's Steakhouse is always a wonderful place to dine. The steaks are amazing. Staff friendly and attentive. For a special occasion or just wanting a good steakhouse this is it.
08/19/2021,WillH,5.0,"Food was terrific. My girlfriend really sucks so thank you for making my experience much better!

Had oysters, crab spring rolls were unbelievable as well. Great porterhouse and the sides are always a win. We will be back!"

08/18/2021,JanetC,5.0,"Delicious food, nice ambience. Friendly waitstaff and attentive. Bar attached if you want a more casual vibe. Can dress up or nice casual. Cozy booths are present for a more cozy feeling, can seat 4. Didn’t see the back of the restaurant it I was very pleased."
08/18/2021,JacquelineB,4.0,Being in the restaurant business myself  ordered porterhouse for two it was a small size for 2 people . Slightly a little dry but cooked medium rare as asked sides were spot on
08/18/2021,RobertM,5.0,"We were very happy with all of our food. The filet was perfect as was the shrimp cocktail. All of the sides were excellent as well. Service was excellent as well. Robert was efficient, but not overbearing. Definitely, highly recommended."
08/18/2021,AmandaB,5.0,Remodeled bar area is awesome! Menu is mostly new. Raw Bar selection is nice - but no crab. I’ve never been to a restaurant with a raw bar that didn’t have crab… Anyway food and service was excellent as usual.
08/15/2021,Robb,1.0,"Fine dining? NOT!! Had to sit and look at some slob in a sleeveless tshirt, aka ""wife beater,"" absolutely no dress code."

08/15/2021,SandyK,5.0,"We had a great serving team.. especially t assistant waiter Logan who was very attentive.
They seated us at a booth facing the outside hallway. It was v private and ""personal"". I love that!
Their Delmonico steak is out of this world... We get this again."
08/15/2021,CharlesK,5.0,Its one of my favorite restaurants. The food is always fantastic and every server I ever had has been outstanding. Thanks for a great experience!!!

08/14/2021,MojoBill,5.0,"We had a great dinner! Steak cooked perfectly! My wife had the short rib pasta, she loved it! Of course we had the garlic bread appetizer. The new renovated bar looks great."
08/14/2021,BelindaR,2.0,"We were disappointed they did not have the specials they had before the reno.  Also they didn't have the St. Francis wine which they did have before.  Also they used to give a complimentary desert for an occasion, it was my husbands birthday and none was offered.  We usually start out with the crab cake app. and that wasn't on the menu."
08/14/2021,AaronS,5.0,"Our entire waitstaff was incredible. 

The menu reflected the actual plated meal perfectly"
08/14/2021,phil,4.0,"Hi i have probably dined with you  8 to 10 times over the years. So this time i noticed some warts.  I know its a noisy room by nature but the music over head was about 25-50 percent to loud.  At times it was difficult to hear my lady across the table. Caesar salad fabulous,  10oz filet could have been the best steak i ever had,  Potatoes mediocre at best. I used to get the lobster mashed and the waitress said because of price yada yada yada we have crab instead.  Tasted garlic and that was about it and to much money for the amount you are given.  Asparagus great.   50 dollar bottle of pinot noir very good. steak dipping sauces very good.  I am not a gambler ( spent 100)  but i spend alot of money on food during the week.  300 dollar bill was ridiculous for wine, salad steak mashed and asparagus. It used to be maybe 175 a couple.  You were always a no brainer go to place when i visit mohegan but now i will probably visit  your mexican restaurant and see your steakhouse on special occasions only. As nice as it is and the quality is very good there is NO value at all .   I need at least a little     thanks  Phil"
08/13/2021,SusanM,4.0,"We and a great experience here the food was good the service was excellent, the place was nice but it was very expensive for what it was. I prefer NYC steak house if I am going to spend that kind of money. Overall very very nice night."
08/13/2021,rebeccac,4.0,"We had the octopus I found it overly salty and also the tuna tartare, did not like how it was served it was better before they changed it.  The short rib pasta was delicious my husband had the filet he enjoyed that with wild mushrooms.  I would of had a ribeye but they no longer have bone/in.  The service and staff were very nice and knowledgeable"

06/30/2021,JosephL,5.0,"Outstanding food and service. Staff was friendly, courteous and helpful. Definitely going to recommend to family and friends."
06/30/2021,DiningL,5.0,We love Michael Jordan's Restaurant.   The food and service are better than 99.9% of other restaurants.   This is worth the price.
06/28/2021,LianaB,5.0,Food was amazing. They really make a great steak.
06/27/2021,AdrienneP,5.0,One of the top dining experiences we’ve had! The food was excellent with great service. Our server even gave us complimentary champagne and dessert when she heard we were celebrating our anniversary. Definitely on the expensive side but well worth it for a special occasion!
06/27/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Service was great!! Attentive, prompt, and friendly.  Food was delicious and portion size was perfect."
06/27/2021,ErinW,5.0,MJ's never fails -- we got 2 seats at the bar right when we walked in and Brad gave us excellent service (saturday night). We got one of the steak specials and the ragu pasta dish - both of which were fantastic.  See you again soon!

06/26/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,It was a great experience with great food
06/26/2021,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Ambiance was nice and staff was very friendly. Drinks were okay, cocktail selection was lacking and the margarita wasn’t great. Food was pretty good, but not worth the money in my opinion. Menu wasn’t huge, apps were good, steak was okay. Overall I think it’s over priced compared to what you get at other steak houses for this cost. I don’t think I’ll be rushing back but it was a decent experience."
06/25/2021,Phil,5.0,Great meal.  Tops in quality for steak.  A busy place on a Friday.  Nice to see the fine dining establishments back again
06/25/2021,MJfan4Life,5.0,"The restaurant seems to have upped its game since the last time we ate here.  The steaks were as good as any we've had anywhere, and the bartenders are among the best.  It's way too expensive, but hey... consider the venue: Mohegan Sun Casino where everything costs at least double what you're normally used to paying for things.  The restaurant though is well worth the elevated price.  We keep returning there year after year and have never really been disappointed.  You should try it at least once."
06/24/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Lovely, food was so flavorful best filet Mignon I’ve ever had. The staff ALL of them were wonderful kept coming to the table. The bleu cheese fondue with bread was oh my gosh amazing. Every thing even the bathroom spotless! I have been to this restaurant multiple times and I have NEVER had a subpar experience. All the servers, chefs, hosts, dishwashers, bus people, clean up crew, bartenders are EXCELLENT.  I took a friend here it was his first time he fell in love instantly. I can go on and on, COVID has been a nightmare coming from a nurse but to see staff take all these precautions keep everyone safe of course including themselves and provide an unforgettable dining experience well worth the $200 price tag, I commend them all and thank them all!"
06/24/2021,DeniceB,5.0,Our server was fantastic.  The food was delicious.  Very good experience!

06/22/2021,Miorac,5.0,"Reservations a must- I’m reviewing the location at the Mohegan Sun. Our server Husain was amazing, the restaurant was busy with large gregarious parties and he still managed to spend time with us and get our orders correct. The lobster bisque is to die for, by far the best I e eaten."
06/22/2021,LesB,5.0,Very good steaks. & the 23 layer chocolate cake a must!

06/20/2021,VanessaR,4.0,"Our waitress and hostess was the best so polite but the gentlemen who I guess was in charge could have been nicer 
I made a reservation and was told to wait so I asked how long the hostess asked the guy and he says to her while I can hear “tell them they need to wait!” 
You don’t say that to a person who came from out of town made a reservation and paying at 65 for a steak 
Everyone else evened out his behavior cause they were so pleasant that it trumped him but he annoyed me"

I have trouble walking and we were seated way to the back of restaurant, a closer table would if been appreciated.  Once seated service was a little slow at first, but once we were waited on-everything was on point!"
06/16/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"It was our anniversary. They seated us in a special booth, gave us 2 glasses of champagne, and a anniversary card signed by all the staff. They made our anniversary dinner extra special. I would definitely recommend"

06/15/2021,DeeDee,5.0,My only complaint is that there were a couple of menu items that were not available.
06/13/2021,terig,5.0,"A most enjoyable evening!  From the warm welcome to the  attentive service and the delicious food.  Our porterhouse steak for two was cooked to perfection-tasty and tender.  Along with the Caesar salad to start and classic mashed potatoes side with the steak, there was little room for anything else.  Portions are more than ample.
Nancy our server was most pleasant and efficient in making sure that all went well for great dinner. We will definitely return."
06/13/2021,Traumamama,3.0,"They were out of many items, including steaks and vegetables. Overpriced and underwhelming"
06/13/2021,ZachK,5.0,Food was excellent. The bacon scallop starter was delicious. The porterhouse for two was cooked perfectly and had an excellent crust. The mashed potato trio side was also excellent. The service was fantastic as well.
06/13/2021,PatM,2.0,Food was just ok... very little choice of side.. crab legs were disappointing and the oysters Rockefeller were poor
06/12/2021,SANVR,5.0,"MJ’s Steak House has never disappointed and this was no different. It was our 20th anniversary dinner and the first dining experience out since pre-covid. The food and service were excellent and sincere. As well, the atmosphere was comfortable and safe. It has always been our go to for special nights out, and definitely will continue to be."
06/12/2021,JoeU,5.0,The steak was excellent but the garlic bread was a bit overdone. If not for that I would have given 5 stars across the board
06/12/2021,YolandaD,5.0,"Celebrated wedding anniversary. Was greeted and served with a smile. All the staff was very pleasant and made sure we were happy and our table was clean. 
The food was fantastic. Quality was great. Steak and lobster tail were out of this world. Melted in your mouth. If someone is worried about ordering steak and having to chew it no need. I ordered truffle parmigiana topping on my steak. It was to die for. 
My husband had the King crab bisque. Sooo goood and the crab cake he ordered had just crab and it wasn’t mushed. It was very large pieces and very meaty., also delicious. 
I would absolutely recommend the Michael Jordan Steakhouse. The way Michael was on court, giving it his all,100%, so does the restaurant reflect him with the ambiance, food and service. 
As I mentioned this was our anniversary dinner, so we were presented with an anniversary card hand signed by the staff and a glass of champagne. 
Thank you for making our dinner memorable and special"
06/11/2021,Phil,4.0,"Not sure why you would sit 2 guys in a room with a business group of 26 individuals?  Had to move our drinks, etc to another table due to all the noise.

Especially with a dinner reservation and open tables."
06/11/2021,DonnaP,5.0,"Delicious food, great wine selection and fabulous service."
06/11/2021,MeganH,5.0,Our waiter Brian was fantastic ! And our steaks were delicious!
06/09/2021,LIFoodlover,4.0,The food was excellent and our waiter was very nice! The GM Dallas could use some polishing up for this type of establishment. Obviously if people are making reservations to pay $100 for a steak the management should know how to treat them.
06/09/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Visiting with family.
06/09/2021,JohnM,5.0,It was probably our fifth dinner at Michael Jordan’s. It’s always excellent. It was the first time for our guest and he was very impressed.
06/09/2021,WilliamP,5.0,atmosphere was great! Service even better! Was my birthday and had it all set for wishing me a happy birthday from my reservations just made for a perfect day
06/09/2021,Pugs,2.0,"This was our 3rd visit.  First 2 were very good.  My issues this time:
* Service felt extremely rushed.  Barely sat down and had not looked at the menu and waiter asked if we knew what we wanted to order.  He was back again probably 3 times in 6 minutes.  Prompt service is great but this was really rushing us.  Waiter was polite and pleasant but we could tell he wanted to turn over the table though.
* I ordered the king crab half portion ($31.00) as an appetizer.  Absolutely the worst crab legs I have ever eaten.  No taste whatsoever.  Gritty sandiness as well.  Awful.
* The scallop entree was not much better.  No taste to scallops. Rubbery.  Menu stated side was ""creamed corn.""  It was not creamed corn, but rather kernel corn that just looked wilted and unappetizing.
* We were done/bill paid and done in less than 45 minutes. When you are eating at a good restaurant, you want to savor the experience..
* Very disappointing overall.

The previous night we ate at Tao which was incredible, so that will be our go-to restaurant going forward."

06/06/2021,IsabellaV,5.0,"Brian was an amazing server! He was so attentive and made himself very presentable. We had no trouble asking him questions and he was very good at explaining each of the items (including the specials) which we had asked for. Not only was Brian attentive, but so was the staff. There was always someone around and our glasses were never close to being empty. The food was excellent as always and we were impressed yet again. Thank you to all of the staff at Michael Jordan's for making our dining experience wonderful yet again!"

05/23/2021,Bill,5.0,Incredible porterhouse steak!! Service was awesome and gave complimentary champagne for birthday.
05/23/2021,StuartB,4.0,"we try and go to MJs 2 or three times a year for special occasions, our anniversary, birthdays etc.  We went for the first time in over a year this past weekend.  The food was very good as usual and our server, Thomas, was terrific.  One thing we noticed was that the portion sizes were smaller than before although the prices for most things were higher.  It was not anything that dampened our experience since in the past we sometimes felt there was too much food; but it was noticeable.  Also they were out of the Kansas City strip which was a disappointment but understandable given the issues with meat supplies in the wake of the pandemic.  I used it as a chance to try something I never ordered before, roast chicken.  It was good, but a little dry, probably not something I would order again.  However the corn was as usual the highlight of the meal (followed closely by the garlic bread).  It never disappoints."
05/23/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Husband and I really enjoyed our date night. Our server was amazing she was very kind as well as the other interactions we had with other staff and I assume managers. The food matched our experience amazing! Food and drinks were on point.

Was not worth the money.

The staff and the decor was excellent."

05/10/2021,JoseA,5.0,Good food quality. The staff was very helpful as our first time they took the time to tell us the best combinations. Is worth it.

05/09/2021,DonnaM,1.0,Server and manager were wonderful. Food however was lacking. Portion sizes were not accurate and small. Food was very salty. Manager made an attempt to correct the issues but they couldn’t get it right. Very apologetic. Could use more variety on the menu. Overpriced for the portion size and quality. Meals in the past have been very good. May have been an off night.

I was disappointed with the French onion soup..(mine is better) and the potato trio was not warm. The Caesar salad was huge and the recommendation to split was excellent.

04/10/2021,EdwardG,4.0,The Steak could have been much better considering the cost. We got the Porterhouse for 2. It was perfectly cooked but was  a bit tough and bland. Thank god for the sauces.  We had the mushroom and cream spinach  sides.
04/10/2021,ChrisD,3.0,"The service was excellent. The Filets were above average, but the sides were awful. Beer taps were broken so could not get a draft beer. Overall it was my 3rd time at Michael Jordan’s. This one was not a good one."

Food and service were great!"
04/04/2021,KimberlyC,1.0,"Horrible experience for my Birthday. I had reservations for 9:15 and we were seated at 9:30. Very first words out of the waitress mouth was not to rush you guys but we close at 11 and everyone has to be out. Very unprofessional and made it seem like we had no choice but to rush to order. Our food came quickly, but the problem is, it was RUSHED. Nothing seemed fresh and well prepared. The food was a huge disappointment for the amount of money we paid. Ruined my whole Birthday dinner experience. I do not recommend this place."
04/04/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Our favorite place to spend our hard earned money when we want to splurge. Server was incredible and the food was 10000000 % on point like always. Can't wit to go back

03/26/2021,Anna,5.0,Julie was a great waitress. Attentive and personable  food was great too
03/26/2021,Brian,1.0,"My steak was undercooked and by the time our server checked in, the rest of our party was done eating so I didn’t want another steak at that point. While clearing the table, our server spilled half a bottle of wine that cost $120 and was offered a glass of house wine rather than replacing the bottle that was spilled. For the minor inconvenience, the manager informed me she would comp a dessert  and a glass of house wine. This is by far the worst dining experience I’ve ever had at a “fine dining” establishment and would suggest going literally anywhere else. Terrible atmosphere, below average food, and atrocious service. Giving one star pains me but unfortunately there isn’t an option for zero stars."
03/26/2021,FredM,5.0,this was a damn good meal with damn good service at price reasonable for what was served. Outstanding steak.

03/21/2021,ljg61,5.0,"Best restaurant in Mohegan Sun. 
Steak was cooked perfect!. Mac & Cheese was delicious. 
Garlic Bread appetizer a ""must have"""
03/21/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Dallas the manager is such an asset to your business. He oversees  the staff and diners  and makes sure your evening is perfection!
03/21/2021,Kennethf,3.0,"We really wanted to love this place as we frequent the Mohegan Sun but its a step behind 2 of our favorite steak places in the area. First the good, the food was really good. I had the KC Strip and my wife had the New York strip. Both cooked to our preference of Medium Rare and seasoned perfectly. The Scallop appetizer was also very good. Our server Jennifer was attentive and friendly. Having said that we would of stuck around for desert or a after dinner drink but the noise was unbearable to endure any longer. Music was playing way too loud and of course guests had to speak over the music which made it even louder. It felt like a bar atmosphere and not a fine dining experience at all. We went pretty early too with a seating at 5:45 PM. All in all its likely we won't return."
03/21/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Great service, great food, great times."
03/20/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Everything was amazing as always. We can’t wait to come back for another delicious meal. Thank you

03/20/2021,ErinW,5.0,"Dallas was wonderful and took care of us from even before we arrived. I had to add to the reservation last minute which he took care of right away, delivered a birthday card to my husband signed by all of the staff, and made sure we had a beautiful dessert to celebrate with. The entire experience was perfect and we appreciate it all. Thank you Michael Jordans Steakhouse AND DALLAS!"
03/19/2021,DurfBurfle,5.0,"This was the perfect anniversary dinner! We were placed in a nice secluded booth on the side, a lovely card from the restaurant wishing us a happy anniversary, complimentary champagne toast... our server was wonderful, just the right amount of attentiveness, very knowledgable on the menu, and had no issues taking our photo or getting anything else we needed during the evening.  Worth every penny!"
03/19/2021,ChristopherT,5.0,Literally the best steak I’ve ever had. I highly recommend to anyone and everyone

03/17/2021,LindaC,5.0,From the minute we walked in we were treated wonderfully with very friendly staff. Recommendations were honest and well received. We were not rushed at all. The food was WONDERFUL! My husband had the pork chop and is still raving about it. Our steak were cooked perfectly. Dessert was amazing and enough for two. We had requested a booth and it was perfect with pillows which helped my back. Can't wait to return!
03/17/2021,ErinO,5.0,Great food and great service and our server Brian was great. The best steak I ever had. I am not sure if its because its inside a Casino or not but they should enforce some level or dress code at this place. Some patrons looked like they were up all night gambling and wearing pajamas.
03/17/2021,DaveM,3.0,"My delmonico ribeye was fantastic, probably the best ribeye I’ve ever had. My wife’s filet was not good, Outback Steakhouse is better. Dry, no taste, tasted like pot roast. We didn’t like the garlic bread app, others rave about it but it just wasn’t to our liking. And strangely, the soda was horrible. Got a diet coke and it tasted like tab, asked for a sprite and it was just as bad."
03/15/2021,MarkL,5.0,"Michael Jordan's Steak House was fabulous. The food was delicious and the steak was made exactly the way we asked.  The potato trio was amazing, especially the lobster mashed. My family and I will definitely be back, next time we visit Mohegan Sun."

03/14/2021,Rita,5.0,Porterhouse was delicious.  Spinach was a little salty

03/14/2021,RobinS,5.0,"Service was outstanding, Brian our waiter was personable and very attentive. Food was delicious as usual which consisted of filet mignon and rib eye both were cooked to our desired preference and the sides were just as enjoyable. A bit pricey however the quality of meat is well worth it."
03/14/2021,BingBing,5.0,Superb dining from the moment we arrived.  Alaskan king crab legs were succulent and delicious.  Wagyu steak melts in your mouth.  The wait staff were extraordinary and the service was impeccable.  Pricing cumulates with the environment.
03/14/2021,KENNIEC,3.0,"It was definitely not as good as I thought it would be the steaks were not hot when served which means the were probably sitting there for a while before being brought to us, and to be honest for the price I’ve had much better steaks at other steakhouses. The ambiance and lighting was great but the noise level was awful.I could barely hear my girlfriend speak and that’s because many guest were behaving like it was a frat house , yelling and carrying on. For the amount of money there are certainly much better options."
03/13/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,It was great.  Food was amazing and waitress was fantastic!

03/12/2021,ARTHURS,4.0,"We were disappointed to find no table available when we arrived at 7pm.  We waited about 15 mins outside the resturant, although we would have enjoyed having a drink while we waited.  No place to have a drink.

After they seated us she brought 2 glass of champagne for me and my husband. The food was AMAZING! We had the crab cake for our appetizer and let me tell you this was my first time trying crabmeat and this crab cake was so delicious I wanted to ordered another one but I didn’t want to spoil my meal. The filet was melting my mouth with lobster tail and lobster mashed potato it was amazing, my husband had a special they had with a strip steak with mash potato with lobster and scallops wrapped in bacon, the waitress was very attentive and friendly, I definitely recommend for special special occasion this place it OUTSTANDING.

02/26/2021,GaryP,5.0,At the price of the steaks it seems a little much to charge for side dishes.
02/25/2021,MeaganC,5.0,We tried the braised ribs this time It was delicious as always
02/25/2021,RayB,5.0,Overall was wonderful. The DelMonico steak was not very flavorful

02/21/2021,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"My wife and I visit once a year, and the food and service is usually outstanding. The most recent visit was subpar to say the least. Food was ok, but the service was wholly lacking. I still left the customary twenty percent tip, but it definitely wasn't earned, especially in comparison to the prices culminating to an average bill of two hundred or more. Waitress attended to us once during our visit and refilled our drinks not during, but after we've completed our meals and appetizers. No excuse in this type of setting, even if the current environment of dining has changed, as the prices have not changed nor should the service."
02/21/2021,Kyanna,4.0,Great place but the food was not good for the price we paid.
02/20/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Service outstanding, Food outstanding!! Coming back for sure !"

02/20/2021,CynthiaM,5.0,Awesome food! Great service! Steak was amazing! Would definitely recommend.
02/20/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,From the host right through dessert perfect. They did a superb job treating my girlfriend special for her 40th birthday. Our porterhouse was crusted with a perfect medium rare center the tri potatoes and creamed spinach where spot on. But I will say we are still debating over the lobster or the Gorgonzola mashed where the better of the three. If your looking to spend a little of your spoils from gaming this is the right choice. Thanks again for a memorable occasion.
02/20/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Anniversary
02/20/2021,christineg,5.0,"Food was fantastic, our waitress Brandy was very friendly and wonderful. She gave us excellent service and made us feel like she wanted us there. The chef wrote in chocolate Happy Birthday on the dessert plate for my husbands birthday. They even brought an extra dessert for me, my birthday was the day before. Dallas  the manager came and greeted us and wished us happy birthday.  Dallas also had a rude person at the door who didn't have a reservation and handled him in a professional manner.  We will be going back."

02/19/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We love this place! Every time we visit Mohegan we make sure to stop in. The garlic bread was amazing as always and the truffle parm crust on your steak is a must! This time we also got bacon wrapped scallops and were were probably the best I’ve ever had.
02/18/2021,BarbraB,5.0,The food was top quality.  Best cosmopolitan and best meatballs I have ever had!

We’ll keep coming back... for sure. 
What an asset Dallas is to MJ!!!"
02/14/2021,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food was great and are server was amazing. I put the noise level at moderate because the restaurant is in a casino so it can not be completely quiet as well as other people dining and the bar area. Despite that are server always made sure we had everything we need and the restaurant manager also asked us how everything was. So I felt respected and attended to.
02/14/2021,ErinM,5.0,"Excellent service, excellent food and excellent wine.  The only issue are the patrons giving the staff a hard time about masks.  The  mental midgets who refuse to wear one are abusing the staff at places they choose to go, knowing full well the mandate is to wear masks. 


 I watched loser after pathetic loser show aggression and abuse towards the incredibly hard working staff at this establishement.  It was a sickening display of idiocy.  These people are seriously the dumbest people on the planet and deserved to have all the covid.  

I truly hope these incredible culinary artists have a company that appreciated them for what they do."
02/14/2021,MatthewD,5.0,Excellent food excellent service equals excellent time we will definitely be back

02/06/2021,HenryS,5.0,"One of my favorite places to dine when at Mohegan Sun. 

I am a creature of habit and I always get the jumbo lump crab cake (did so thsi time) and the NY Strip. This time our server Adrian mentioned the Wagu special that came with surf and turf option. Glad she did cause it was out of this world! My only wish is that this would make it's way to the regular menu items."

01/15/2021,annar,1.0,I found bones in both of my meals I was not satisfied and I feel like the entire experience should have been comped.

01/10/2021,WaeelS,3.0,"We were seated inside one of the few booths available.  It was very nice!  I was displeased with the limited menu.  No vegetables or baked potato were available.  They also had no kids menu available.  My steak was served just warm, and burnt on the outside.  I like my food served hot.  I will not be returning to Michael Jordon’s!"
01/09/2021,HenryS,5.0,"Open table reservation made it so easy. Walked right in (line for those who did walk-in) and was seated in 3 min from arrival. The dinning area is spaced so felt very comfortable.

Nancy our wait staff was friendly and took the time to explain to my gf (first time there) how the steaks are aged.

Apps came out in less than 7 min. Food is always great which is why I keep going back.

Extra nice touch is the dessert (we did not order) when they found out it was her birthday. Classy!"
01/09/2021,Danielb,5.0,Brought my lady for her Birthday they really know how treat people gave her a card & dessert with a candle no charge every one was very friendly highly recommend  .
01/09/2021,JoanM,3.0,"I wanted to celebrate my 50th birthday at a phenomenal steak house and booked Michael Jordan’s. We arrived 15 min prior to our reservation time and we were asked to wait outside, understandable as they were seating other people ahead of us. So, we went and grabbed a drink across the hall and returned 15 min later. The maitre’d was very aggressive and obviously takes his job and COVID very seriously as he screamed my last name to get our attention to seat us, walked at an expeditious rate to the table, and all but tore my husbands head off when he inadvertently put his hand near his mask to repeat an answer to his question that neither of them heard making the experience of seating us extremely uncomfortable. His banter of “rules” was also uncomfortable during the seating process and frankly made the rest of the evening uncomfortable and unenjoyable. Especially when he came back to check on us....was he going to reprimand us again?? Overall, not what we expected for spending that much money. The server however, was a joy. And therefore the 3 stars. He gets none.  Not going back if he is there in the future."
01/09/2021,LarryM,5.0,"I’m at a loss for words I felt like we were having dinner with friends. Dallas  is amazing!  The staff is great and very accommodating. We will be back on 2/12 the anniversary of our first date 42 years ago! See you soon!

Larry and Susan"
01/08/2021,Superb,3.0,"Made a reservation at Micheal Jordan’s through Open Table since I had a $10 reward from Open Table due to the many reviews I’ve made for them over the years.  Our waitress Jen was outstanding!  She was the highlight of the evening.  The food and bottle of wine were good.  The problem arose when we went to pay the bill and the manager approached our table with the $10 Open Table reward voucher saying it didn’t work and he couldn’t get through the phone number.  He asked to see my phone app that stated I had this reward, which I did.  He agreed it was there but instead of taking it off my bill, he said “I’ll take $10 off your next visit”.  What kind of cheap response is that?  I just spent over $300 for a meal for 2 people and he won’t give us the $10 coupon?  It’s not about the $10, it’s the way we were made to feel like we were trying to cheat this establishment.  Ruined the entire experience.  This will be my last review on Open Table because according to the manager at Micheal Jordan’s Steakhouse at Mohegan Sun, their reward cards don’t work."
01/08/2021,Diningoutalot,5.0,Great service and everything was delicious. The pork chop was the best!

01/01/2021,PeterZ,5.0,"It was New Year’s Eve and a 30 minute wait. But let me tell you, it was incredible! I ordered the surf and turf special.The filet melted in my mouth and cooked perfectly. The scallops wrapped in bacon were delicious. They were so large that I had to cut into four pieces. The lobster mashed potatoes were the best and had so much lobster, it could’ve been a meal on its own. The server Ryan was great. Attentive and personable. The hostess had sent two glasses of champagne and a garlic bread appetizer as a thank you for waiting so patiently. It was overall a five star meal!"
01/01/2021,jeannieh,2.0,My husband and I both had steak. He ordered his medium and it arrived very rare. Both steaks were tough. Very disappointing.
12/31/2020,PALM4Kids,4.0,"NYE.  Steak was top notch, one of the best I have had in a while. The sides were not great.  Apps were okay."

12/28/2020,Christina,3.0,"Overall we had a great experience...
I ordered a surf and turf special (In-bone filet, mashed potatoes with a lobster, scallops wrapped in bacon)- I asked for the steak medium well- unfortunately it was not done that way. The manager was nice enough to remake my steak. We asked for the bill and the remade steak to be boxed because it had taken over 35 minutes for them to remake it. It was late and we were tired as we had been there for about an hour and a half already. The manager wanted to see the bill before the server brought it over (which is what our server told us). We waited another 20 minutes and the server brought our check and told us that for the inconvenience the manager took off $56 which we were surprised by.  Upon looking at the check the manager took off the steak that he redid and a $13 inconvenience fee. We mentioned it to the server and he apologized for incorrectly explaining it to us. It was unfortunate. I wish the manager had addressed it himself and felt that it was important to correct the issue in a more timely manner. We had an overall good time but this left a sour taste and I'm not sure that we would return. One thing I will boast about is their incredible garlic bread- best I've ever had! It is an actual menu item that must be ordered as an appetizer."
12/27/2020,james,5.0,"One of the best, you never get credit for using open table"
12/27/2020,Nadya,5.0,excellent place Very delicious dinner and atmosphere
12/26/2020,Ally,3.0,Everyone there was nice.  My only complaint was I requested a birthday dessert to be delivered to our table for a birthday surprise but i guess nobody read that note. They did put out a card but the dessert was what I wanted.

They were both friendly and we had an enjoyable conversation. Next we were seated in a very cozy booth and had a fabulous dinner. At the end of meal, we received 2 glasses of champagne as an anniversary toast. Will be back on our next visit to Mohegan Sun."

Jimmy was so helpful while explaining the specials and making sure we had what we needed the entire time. We were celebrating my husband's birthday and I left a simple message on our open door reservation. MJs steakhouse went above and beyond to make his dinner extra special. Beyond the great service, The food was awesome, flavorful and well prepared. I highly recommend this restaurant, it's the total package."

12/04/2020,JeffreyC,5.0,Love this restaurant the food and service outstanding. We had dinner there a year ago and had one of the best meal ever. We looked so forward to going again. We wanted the same thing we had last year but it was a special and wasn't on the menu this time. The waiter said they might be able to do it for us but had the ask the chef.  They pulled it off and we had the Legendary Flight off the menu. Thank you. Will be there again.
11/28/2020,JackG,5.0,Everything was perfect. Jimmy was our server and he was terrific. He was extremely personable and equally knowledgeable. His attention to detail added a special element to our dining experience. We are certainly looking forward to our next visit.
11/28/2020,RachaelC,5.0,"Overall, we enjoyed our visit to MJ's. I took my husband for his birthday. The server was amazing and attentive. Ny food was pretty good. My husband wasn't really a fan of his steak. He had been talking about it for weeks, and he seemed really let down. He didn't really eat his steak. All of our other food was delicious. For dessert we ordered the creme brulee, which is one of our favorite desserts. It tasted odd. We still ate it. But it just didn't taste like creme brulee. 

We will definitely go back again at some point. Very likely we wont order the same meal again. Might give the creme brulee another chance."
11/28/2020,Chrissy,5.0,"I feel  just repeat myself everytime I write a review.  THE BEST!!!!!  These people get it.  Bet steak hands down and the staff are the most friendly, inviting staff.  They make you feel like you are sitting down a table with family.  Miss Yak though the manager.  He was the best!!!!!!"
11/28/2020,Lainie,5.0,One word. Fabulous.  Food is great and service is top notch.  You will not be disappointed.
11/27/2020,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"First time here and from entry, sitting down, and presentation by our waiter, was excellent. The appetizers to our main course to the wonderful steaks was on point and didn’t disappoint. If I had to give one negative, it would be that the crumbs that are cleaned up usually after meals at other fine restaurants, was not scraped off the table. But besides that, excellent service and excellent food."
11/27/2020,stevet,4.0,all good but always seems to be someone real loud near us
11/26/2020,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Great food. Terrific service.  However, super over priced.   I’m not a penny pincher by any stretch of the imagination, but not worth the money.  Thanksgiving day, only my wife and I.  Three drinks, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 sides.......$240.00.   Wow!!!"
11/26/2020,April1,4.0,"Salad, fondue and steak couldn’t have been better.  I would rate them as excellent.  However, the lobster mashed potatoes were very dry.  We ordered the lobster potatoes in the past and they were delicious.  This wasn’t the case on our last visit."
11/26/2020,Caroln,5.0,"Wonderful non traditional TGiving dinner.  Had the first 3pm reservation and appreciate that you opened the doors at 3pm and not later. Only complaint which we did not order (did order the last two years in a row). The shrimp in the shrimp cocktail are too big, too tough and so ice cold they almost taste frozen. Did not order because of that reason. Wish you had a little more vegetarian on the menu. My daughter does eat lobster so you always give her two tales which works for us   Great waiter can not remember his name. Tall, good looking, older (haha older meaning 40?). Excellent service!"
11/23/2020,RogerD,5.0,"Always a great time, with great steaks and great service!"
11/22/2020,Nakeisha,5.0,"My now fiancé and I celebrated our engagement here and we were very pleased . Our server was very attentive and overall I loved the ambiance . Although we did not have steak that night , the other food choices we had were very yummy . My fiancé had the short rib and I opted for Caesar salad with shrimp . Very fulfilling and the drinks were on point . We visit many restaurants not to mention  steakhouses  and this place is  definitely is on  list. Wouldn’t mind visiting again."
11/22/2020,PatriciaFletcher,3.0,I was not impressed with the food at all. The service was wonderful our waiter couldn’t of been more accommodating and nicer the concierge’s was great as well. We had some issues with our mashed potatoes and they did the right thing but overall I wouldn’t go back I was not impressed with the quality of the food for the price

11/07/2020,MichaelT,5.0,"This restaurant is always consistently great!
The steaks are obviously their strength, but several menu items are outstanding.
Their wedge salad is among the better ones that I’ve had and they have one appetizer and one side dish that are out of this world.
The double cut bacon appetizer is delicious and something you don’t see on any other menu.
And their side of Mac’ n cheese uses 4 different cheeses and is the best I’ve ever tasted."

10/30/2020,MarioG,4.0,"The waiter was fantastic! He described the food and made great recommendations! The steaks were OK, cooked very well, meaning good however the sides were little to be desired. Specifically wasting your money on the lobster mashed potatoes, they had no taste at all they were dry and not worth it! We had the pork belly appetizer which was very good, could’ve been a little better prepared as it was a little tough but the taste was very good!"
10/29/2020,KathiriaC,5.0,Service was amazing and very friendly! The place was clean and beautiful.
10/29/2020,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Always a fabulous time at MJ! We had Brian as our server, he was so knowledgeable! It was my friends birthday and they had a birthday card for her when we were seated, and a complementary mini dessert at the end. The bartenders are always amazing  especially Shirley who makes me delicious mocktails since I’m preggo. Ryan the expo always has a smile on his face and makes sure the food comes out hot and perfect. Chief always does an amazing job, food is always consistent. Whether it’s a solo dinner, date night or celebration this place is the spot to go!"

10/25/2020,SPANKY,3.0,"We have eaten here before and always thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  However, this time was not nearly as good as in the past.  The steak was not as tender and for the price spent it should be."

10/24/2020,LarryM,5.0,Dallas and his staff are amazing.  I can’t wait to go back on 11/22 it can’t come fast enough!!!
10/23/2020,SusanK,1.0,"Location, noise, all service, drinks, appetizers, ambiance all very good. Menu variety was ok, should add a few more budgeted items in both apps and entrees. Everything is ala carte as they politely tell you ahead of time, (thank you). The trio of mashed potatoes were awesome and the Filet Mignon 7 oz with Shrimp was half good. Two large shrimp, coated well and an overdone steak that somehow was pink in the middle still but dry and not seasoned. It was a 7 oz that looked like 3 oz and after two slices was hard to ask to take it back. People LOVE this restaurant, I was not fond of paying that much on every item and not proportioned to that cost. All staff persons were awesome! To sum this visit...for two ...we had 2 drinks ea, shared app and dessert and ordered the same 'special' and was a $300 bill (tip not included yet). Went once, I'm good....well unless if I win big and want to splurge would give it a second try because so many people do rave about it."

09/30/2020,MargaritaMJ,4.0,"Excellent meal. 4 instead of 5 stars because it is a bit over priced. We dined for my husband's birthday. We were greeted with a birthday card and seated at a cozy both. Our server, JessMac made our entire experience that much better. She was amazing.  Shout out to her!  We had garlic bread with a blue cheese dipping fondue and wedge salad. Both were amazing! The bacon on the salad was hearty and flavorful, the lettuce crisp & tender and wonderful dressing. We had the special for dinner,  2 oz of lobster scampi and 3 jumbo bacon wrapped scallops with a 7 oz filet. Everything was cooked to perfection.  My Margarita was delicious and had a nice salted rim... I was happy about that.  They brought out a little brownie sundae for Paul's birthday. Everything was awesome!"

Feeling really good during very tricky times. Thanks Michael Jordans  Restaurant for making it a great experience. Will always be on my dinner list at Mohegan Sun.
09/20/2020,Stoltgirl,5.0,My boyfriend had the steak which he loved and the spinach was outstanding.  I had the salmon which wasn't as good and so I really did not eat much of my meal.  The waitress noticed and asked me how it was.  I was honest and said I really didn't care for it. She offered to bring me something else but at that point I was not hungry.  When the bill came they  did not charge for my meal.  I thought that was very nice of them.  They are very accommodating and we will definitely be back but this time I will enjoy the steak.

Secondly the entire dinner took 1 hour and 50 minutes which seemed to be much to long of a dinner time wise."
09/16/2020,BrettL,5.0,I had the Japanese A-5 Wagyu steak and it was cooked perfectly. Came in for my anniversary and neither me or my lady was disappointed. Chef Kevin came out and talked with us. Service was unbelievable and steaks were even better. Very impressed!

09/13/2020,JADE,3.0,"It’s ok. Was super expensive for basic food in my opinion. Steak was good yes but not $60 good with no side. Waitress was very attentive and nice, however the host who checked us in was extremely rude. I wish I had his name. Won’t be going here again... eh."
09/13/2020,ElleA,5.0,"Food was good! But after seeing the menu for MJ23 next door, I feel a little played. There were a lot of the same menu items for less $$. However, I know we were paying for ambiance. Our server was amazing and very pleasant! Due to covid there were less tables available, which was really nice as we only had 3 other tables dining in the same room as us."
09/13/2020,Kurt,4.0,The steaks are excellent. I had the MVP dinner which gives you 4 different selections of steak and they were all excellent. It fed 4 of us perfectly. You have to pay extra for the sides which are also delicious. I would definitely recommend Michael Jordan Steakhouse to my friends.
09/12/2020,MoiraS,5.0,"We went here for a one year anniversary. They were super nice about it, gave us a little card and everything. The waitress was so sweet, the food delicious and plentiful! And SOMEHOW they worked with my fiancé so he could propose to me. They kept it a secret somehow, and I was super surprised! It just made the night all the more special!"
09/12/2020,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We had an amazing time. Everything was really delicious we will definitely be coming back again. Thank you for an amazing experience

09/11/2020,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"It was amazing! Brian our server took the time to explain everything on the menu. Including what he would recommend down to what time of year it’s good to have certain dishes. The steaks were cooked to perfection! The trio mash potatoes were a good size that can be shared between two people. We also got the garlic bread and the meatballs for an appetizer and those were TO DIE FOR. Also, I told the waitress it was my fiancé’s birthday and they brought out a card signed by everyone there and nice ice-cream and brownie desert. I would definitely go again! I felt like I got my money’s worth. 5/5 stars"
09/11/2020,sharonp,5.0,"Excellent service from beginning to end.  The hostess was pleasant and promptly brought us to our seat.  They gave us a birthday card, because we noted it was a birthday celebration when we made our reservation with open table.  Our waitress Julia was a joy.  She was thoughtful and pleasant throughout.  The food was delicious and cooked to order thanks to Julia's expertise.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to all my family and friends."

09/10/2020,concertman53,5.0,"Our reservation was right on time. My wife and Ienjoyed our visit. We usually get the blue cheese garlic bread but we ordered their daily special appetizers today. I had grilled pork belley and my wife had a clam and mussel in wine broth dish. Both were excellent. Foe dinner I had the bone in rib eye and my wife the dinner special which was a filet served on lobster mashed potatoes with a topping of lobster. We also ordered the garlic spinich side and a bottle of wine. We both like our steaks medium rare and both were cooked to perfection. My wife was not too happy with the lobster on top of her steak, she said it tasted like it was from a can and not fresh. Other than that everything was very good. The service was excellent as well with just the right kind of attention. Glasses were kept full and we were checked in with but not enough to be intrusive, just the right amount. Highly recommend you make a reservation especially now with COVID."
09/09/2020,SusZ,4.0,Make sure to request pricing on daily specials. I loved one of the offerings but wound up paying TWICE the price of the normal  meal choice offering!!!!!
09/09/2020,PatrickE,5.0,Excellent food and service
09/06/2020,louisi,4.0,"We had dinner reservations for 7 pm party of four. Arrived on time but waited until 7:30 be we were seated. The manager, Dallas  was polite  but overwhelmed with the amount of people waiting for a table. Needed help.  Our waitress was also nice, helpful and polite, Julie. Nice qualities. The food was pricey( understand) but not what we expected. Example, my Rib Eye steak was under cooked and tough. Dallas did removed it from our check, nice. It was okay and you should try the restaurant."
09/06/2020,AsiaR,5.0,Very good service. The food was excellent. My husband enjoyed everything. Our service was wonderful. We were not disappointed on bit.

We highly recommend this place for anyone looking for an excellent experience. Thanks for helping us celebrate our special day!!"

09/04/2020,ScottS,5.0,Every part of our meal was outstanding. The garlic bread and bacon were an excellent way to get started.  Then the steak was cooked to perfection .
09/04/2020,Srsalemi64,3.0,Service was good. But the appetizers were cold!! Then after reheating them they push our entree on us and the lobster tail and scallops wrapped in bacon were cold too!! Very disappointed and I won’t go back. Not for a $250 meal that’s cold.
09/03/2020,MichaelC,4.0,A little surprised at the somewhat loud music but overall good.

08/30/2020,PaulP,2.0,Went for a nice 47th Anniversary dinner and thought we chose the best restaurant at Mohegan Sun and was surprised of the quality of the steaks for the price we paid.  Very tough Filet and Delmoaco  steaks. The waitress was excellent and the Manager did his best and the replacement steak was a little better.
08/30/2020,NildaB,5.0,"We were celebrating our 28th wedding anniversary and it was MAGNIFICENT! From the moment we arrived we were wished congratulations and a Happy Anniversary card was given to us. The food was amazing and I can’t say enough about the service. Our waitress Jen was attentive, and very helpful in making a choice with dinner. She was also super sweet!!! They even gave us champagne on the house. Thank you so much for making our special night so memorable!! Will definitely be back!!!"

08/29/2020,KellyR,5.0,"We really enjoyed our experience at Michael Jordan's.  My husband enjoyed the 16 oz steak with crusted truffle, cooked to perfection.  I enjoyed the Crab leg special.  We also enjoyed the tuna tartare appetizer, it was fresh and delicious.  Our waitress Julie was wonderful.  The restaurant is handling Covid rules very well.  Certainly would recommend and would return."
08/29/2020,KeithB,5.0,Great place to eat! wonderful place to relax and enjoy the fine food!
08/29/2020,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Overall we had a good experience but we were underwhelmed by the steaks. Our waiter Jimmy was awesome and always made sure we had everything we needed and more! He was a great addition to the experience we had and I would definitely come back to see him again!
08/28/2020,maryn,5.0,We love coming here and always eat at the bar and get the best service from Shirley and the boys!
08/27/2020,Anonymous,3.0,Steak was ok Not well seasoned. Wine selection was limited. Service was excellent and made the experience a nice one. Food was ok. Overpriced for ok food
08/26/2020,Legasea,5.0,Excellent food and service.
08/26/2020,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellent food as always. Nice ambiance. Honestly service could be better. Waiter takes the order and you never see him again until food arrives? Shouldn’t have to beg for water!
08/26/2020,Raffaela,5.0,The food was fabulous.  The service spectacular!   The atmosphere was perfect.   Can’t wait to back.
08/24/2020,LeslieC,1.0,"The food was not worth the price, the drink tasted just like medicine the only good drink was the wine"
08/23/2020,Rosannf,5.0,Awesome meal.  Its one of the best restaurants as Mohegan.
08/23/2020,MargaritaMJ,4.0,"I have dined here multiple times. This experience was very good and would have been 5 stars with a few exceptions. I ordered the special Margarita, rocks, salt. They would not/could not put salt on the rim.  Some sort of Covid restaurant policy. Must have been specific to Michael Jordan’s as I had no issues getting a salted rim at other Mohegan Sun venues. The Soltoro Margarita was ok, nothing special.  The French onion soup was not up to its usual standards. I lacked some “heartiness” and flavor. Very skimpy on the cheese. Disappointing compared to the usual. We both ordered the special: filet, 3 jumbo scallops wrapped it bacon and lobster scampi atop of some mashed potatoes. The filet was amazing, as were the scallops (and I’m not big fan of scallops..so you know they were great).  On the other hand, the lobster scampi lacked scampi sauce and the lobster pieces were overcooked. The bread is wonderful and it was a very nice date night.  We’ll definitely return."
08/23/2020,KikiG,5.0,"ALL the food we had was outstanding!!!  Appetizer: Garlic bread with blue cheese; Main course: Rib eye Steak...cooked to perfection; Lamb Chops...very succulent!!  Side dishes were the trio of mashed potatoes and Macaroni and Cheese....definitely not your ""run-of-the-mill""!
We were celebrating a Birthday and the honoree was given a birthday card signed by the whole staff as well a surprise birthday dessert.
The service throughout was impeccable....very friendly and eager to please!
I will definitely return to Michael Jordan's Steak House. Even though it was ""pricey"", I feel it was well worth it!"
08/23/2020,AdelaG,4.0,"Had a wonderful time! The food, the ambience and the service was exceptional! Danielle was our waitress and she made great suggestions. She was informative, kind and a pleasure. 

We will definitely go back!"
08/22/2020,LisaG,5.0,Our waiter Jimmy was amazing- very knowledgeable about the menu and you could tell that he took a great amount of pride in making sure that we had an outstanding dining experience. He’s truly an asset to the MJ team! The food was cooked to perfection- my husband I both had the filet mignon special with lobster scampi and it was fabulous- the price point was very reasonable for all that you got with it (mashed potatoes and 3 of the largest bacon-wrapped scallops I have ever seen)! I totally recommend MJ’s for a special night out!
08/22/2020,LinaS,5.0,We were celebration my husbands birthday.  It was amazing.  Signed card and birthday wishes that followed.  Service was attentive and friendly.  Food was the star.

08/20/2020,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Very lovely. Delicious cocktails and food. 

Table behind us was rather loud and was speaking vulgar- as a female made me feel uncomfortable. 

Otherwise our waitress was wonderful as well as the gentleman that greeted us upon arrival."
08/19/2020,ColleenW,4.0,"Food was good service was great! I was not a fan of their signature garlic bread it was very very hard, crunchy is one thing but it was just to hard."
08/16/2020,MarshaN,5.0,"Another gem of a restaurant, it's worth even traveling to! I remembered from about 20 yrs ago those filet mignons and lobster mashed potatoes! That's really memorable, such that it was still a delight to have these again! Among other fine food and drinks, w an extensive wine list. My friend was also blown away!"
08/16/2020,Skullster,4.0,Always great good and good service!  We had filet mignon bone in with bone marrow butter and collasol crab cake as an entree. Steak cooked perfectly and crab tender and delicious!
08/16/2020,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The ambiance is perfect for a date night and the food is incredible. Very friendly and helpful staff as well. Made date night very special!
08/16/2020,Josem,5.0,For the price you pay the foods not all there. The service was great but for an upscale restaurant the menu could have been bigger and have more to offer. The portions are very small for the price.

08/01/2020,AshleyD,4.0,Dinner was decent. I don’t think I would return since it was a long trip and 1 of our steaks was tough & over cooked. I expected better from an “exceptional” rated restaurant.
07/31/2020,Joey,4.0,"Little expensive, but one of the better restaurants in the casino"
07/31/2020,wayne,4.0,Very consistent. Service was great.

07/30/2020,DerekS,4.0,Excellent steak and ice cold beer. Meal was paced nicely from apps to dinner. Only complaint was the lobster mashed potatoes in the mashed trio. No one at the table enjoyed the lobster mashed it was terrible. Everything else was exceptional!
07/27/2020,MarleneS,5.0,"with the pandemic, choices for fine dining are few.  Michael Jordan's is very pricey, but the food is totally worthwhile.  The service is excellent, the wait staff is outstanding."

07/25/2020,Cutiepie,3.0,"Overall, we did enjoy our meals.  However, other than finding it to be a little pricey, my chicken dish and my friend's chicken dish were luke warm.  My husband's mashed potatoes were nice and hot.  The French Onion Soup could have been hotter.  Our other friend ordered a pork chop and he said it was good."
07/25/2020,OpenTableVIPJeff,2.0,Took forever to get our drinks. When they came one person who ordered the punch said it tasted like robutussin a Moscow mule had no ginger beer in it. It was like a glass of vodka. Took 20 minutes to correct that. Condensation from the AC system was dripping on one of us. Food was ordinary. French onion soup was very salty. The bacon was good. The steaks were not seasoned enough. The Delmonaco was asked for it to be cut from the chuck side. It wasn’t. The Mac and cheese side was a few steps up from Kraft. The cheese they used was bland. We didn’t even want to investigate dessert. Try harder MJ!
07/24/2020,redrose5200,5.0,"We ordered the filet mignon and the Bone-In Kansas City Strip, both steaks were amazing.  Jimmy was our waiter and he did a fantastic job, he was very personable."
07/24/2020,pacmangolf,5.0,"Here celebrating the birthday weekend. 
Our table was waiting when we checked in and my wife was greeted with a pleasant happy birthday greeting. 
Simone did a great job of pacing our meal.
Our meal began by splitting and order of bacon wrapped scallops which came with a great mustard aioli which were cooked perfectly and very tasty. 
The petite filet Oscar was delivered as order a perfect medium rare. The short rib served over pappardelle was out of this world. 
To finish the night we went with the cheesecake served with berries and adorned with a candle a nice touch that put a smile on my wife’s face. 
Thanks for a relaxing well paced night... til the next time..."
07/24/2020,DanielleC,5.0,Always a great meal at MJs.  Jimmy was our server and he made everything  go off without a hitch.  Outstanding fellow and knows his craft.  We will be asking for his tables when we go again.
07/24/2020,CKitch,5.0,"07/24 reservation 5:30 
 (Distancing  and safe practices were strictly followed)
I come to Jordan’s because the grill on the protein  is always perfect. The temperature on the steak and pork chops are on point. The lobster dishes are delicious. Our server was polite, professional, and familiar with the current and past menu. 

There is just an issue, with the floors being a bit slippery between the dining room and bathroom, this is actually the second visit I almost slipped while going to the restroom and I am very steady on my feet.

I look forward to coming again.  The service has been impeccable and it is my favorite restaurant when visiting the casino.

Thank you,
CK"

07/18/2020,Colleen,5.0,"We were seated on time and had our drinks immediately. Our starters came out within 10 mins.  The trio of mashed potatoes are great and enough for two.  Other than our steaks being cooked the way the other wanted, within degrees, the steak was great."

Tables were properly spaced out. The food was DELICIOUS! Jimmy our waiter was FANTASTIC! Personable, knowledgeable and just great! I know it’s a hard environment to work in. Wearing the mask for long hours is tough but Jimmy did it perfectly. Kept us informed on any changes because of covid, checked on us a perfect amount of times and was always friendly.

07/09/2020,ReneF,2.0,"The streak, while cooked well, was far too salty... Almost inedible.  Meatball appetizer and macaroni and cheese were just ok. Garlic bread with cheese fondue and French onion soup was great. Overall... Not worth 220 dollars for two people."
07/09/2020,FrankM,5.0,"Great meal as usual, great service,  good value for the meal I ordered. Server and staff treated us like we were special guests. Will return the next time that we come to Mohegan Sun."
07/05/2020,GeriC,2.0,"First of all, I realized that adjustments have to be made during this time due to the Virus. That being said, MJ restaurants felt more like a Diner with low lighting.  The place is so dated, tables and the set up of the restaurant was so uninviting. As for the food, ordered Crab cake, Caesar salad, filet mignon and creamed spinach. The crab cake was really good, Caesar salad was so tangy, creamed spinach had so much breading - it didn’t look like there was much spinach in it at all. The filet mignon was not bad but it lacked taste and also there was no presentation at all, it was just a piece of steak on a large plate, no garnish whatsoever.   We ordered a special drink of blue cheese olive martini. It was served with no olives as they ran out of blue cheese."
07/05/2020,Robss,5.0,"From the host to my waiter jimmy service was outstanding as well as food. Special of filet, bacon scallops and picked lobster was amazing. A little pricey but worth the treat. So nice to dine out again. Loved it"

07/05/2020,Bunny,5.0,Fantastic food fantastic service I have been there before and I will go there again it was a little pricey no dessert and 1 glass of wine between the two of us and the bill was $300 with the tip but I felt it was worth it however the restaurant it’s self was lackingin Formality for the price my booth seat was torn up I had to sit on the other side you pay a fancy price you should eat in a fancy decor
07/05/2020,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Love everything they have on menu eat here all the time
07/04/2020,LWIT,5.0,"This was our first time dining at Michael Jordan's.  We were pleased with our choice.  The food was delicious and the service outstanding.  The cost was pricey, but we were well aware of that ahead of time.  Thankfully we had Momentum Points!"

06/27/2020,JonF,2.0,Service was horrendous. Forgot our sides. Didn't describe any details of the two specials offered for the evening. Meals took over 90 minutes. Almost 1 hour after apps were cleared we received entrees. Will not be back

Our server Jennifer and her two associates, Carlos and Ryan, did a wonderful job. The food as always was so very good and the garlic bread with Maytag blue cheese just so tasty as a starter. Good wine choices abound as well."
03/09/2020,LisaD,5.0,A particularly good night at Michael Jordan’s since there was a basketball game and the restaurant was very quiet. Had an absolutely delicious porterhouse steak.

03/07/2020,Ivanusa,3.0,This dinner was for a birthday celebration and no candle was placed on my desert. The filet was not cooked properly and the garlic bread was to hard to eat.
03/06/2020,Mhstks,5.0,It is amazing!  Pricey but worth every cent!  Especially their blue cheese fondue.  We all had the filet mignon and it was cooked to perfection.  Service was impeccable. I recommend a reservation as it fills up fast?
03/06/2020,DavidD,5.0,My wife and I went to MJs for our anniversary dinner while staying at Mohegan Sun. The meal was great and the service was top notch! Kudos to our waiter Jimmy for his attentiveness and willingness to meet our every dietary need.

03/01/2020,donsman,4.0,"Service and food were exceptional.  Our reservation for 7:15 was not honored, needed to wait 45 minutes, this was a concern since we do frequent this restaurant yearly."
02/29/2020,mpnwd,5.0,"The food and service never disappoint. Could eat the garlic bread every day. They were overbooked, so we had to wait 35 minutes for our table, which was disappointing, as we missed the first 25 minutes of the show we were seeing. This had never happened before to us. In the future I would err on the side of caution if you are heading to a concert or event and book earlier."
02/29/2020,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Always a treat!..... dine here 2 x a year. Always look forward to this perfect, decedent meal!...👍"
02/29/2020,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Hands down a great night! Perfect atmosphere paired with a great menu and service 👍
02/29/2020,CTTravels,4.0,"Garlic bread was overrated and pushed hard by our waitress.  Corn is delicious.  My dinner was filet with bacon wrapped scallops, and while tasty, were cold.  The butter they put on the top of the filet never melted at all.  My wife's strip steak was ordered medium well but came out medium, and was served at a good warm temperature, which actually worked well for me as that's how I prefer it.  The fries were hot and fresh, with the sauce on the side, which I appreciated.  Service was very good, and everyone was very pleasant.  Table was a bit worn, might be time for a soft remodel."
02/28/2020,TedmanM,5.0,The food and service were excellent! I truly enjoyed the ambiance-- the waiter was very courteous.
02/28/2020,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Amie was an AMAZING waitress! Food was phenomenal, can’t wait to come back!!"
02/25/2020,MikeP,5.0,"Our server was Chris and he did an excellent job.  I did not tip him enough.  I wanted to give him 20% and by mistake I only gave him 10%.  The next time we go there, we want to be in his section to compensate the tip."
02/24/2020,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Always amazing!
02/24/2020,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"I told the staff ahead of time that it was a special date night for my wife and me. They gave us a nice secluded booth and the food was ANAZING! At the end, they gave us a complimentary dessert with glasses of champagne. This place did it right! I highly recommend them. It’s a pricey place, but that’s to be expected for what you get."
02/23/2020,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Anniversary
02/23/2020,katenyc,5.0,"Fantastic steak and great service.  We waited a little bit past our reserved time for our table in the front of the restaurant which was packed and very noisy.  But then we were seated in back at a very nice table which was significantly quieter so we could hear each other.  Our server and her assistant were super nice and very attentive.  The food came out quickly, which was amazing considering how busy they were.  The garlic bread is worth the trip - toasted bread with garlic butter sitting in a pool of creamy cheese sauce - don't miss it.  My sirloin was cooked perfectly to my rare-medium rare order and so was my husband's well done filet mignon, which was terrific.
Expensive but not out of line with other good steak houses and everything was great."
02/22/2020,Djlan,4.0,"The only thing we were disappointed with was the garlic bread it was much harder than usual and didn’t taste as good as we have had in the past 
Otherwise everything else was amazing 
The waiter was very nice and gave me a birthday brownie which was very nice"
02/22/2020,FrankieBoy,5.0,What a perfect evening. Food was amazing. Service was excellent !! Highly recommended.
02/22/2020,Maryt,5.0,"Excellent food, great service.  Would definitely eat there again."
02/22/2020,AndrewA,3.0,"We waited quite a while for someone to approach our table, and that slow service continued throughout dining.  The steak was good, but not great compared to other steak houses we had been to.  We may give it a second try in the future as we have enjoyed the bar side multiple times before so maybe this was not the typical experience."
02/21/2020,Eddie,5.0,We come to Michael Jordan’s almost every time we visit Mohegan. The service is great and the food is also. Crab cake to die for.

Everyone was professional the food was extremely fresh and prepared with passion. Well oiled machine."

02/16/2020,PhyllisR,5.0,Great food from the seafood tower to filet mignon entry.  Delicious.
02/16/2020,ADLV,2.0,"I attended the MJ Steakhouse on Saturday 2/15 with a couple from Philadelphia and the food was absolutely delicious.  When I made the reservations I asked if they accept Resorts Atlantic City points and they said that they do.  I have over 900 points on my card and my couple friends have over 3,000 points on their card.  When I presented my card after dinner to the wait person, she returned and said it was rejected.  Of course we were very embarrassed so my friends offered their card and she again returned and said that their card was rejected.  The diners at the tables in our vicinity were listening to the whole conversation and it was again most embarrassing.  I then asked the wait person to please contact Resorts by telephone because she must be doing something wrong.  She then admitted that she didn't know how to process the Resort cards.  She then took my card and went back to the desk and I then asked my friends to meet me later at the casino because it was most embarrassing for them.  About 15 minutes later, the wait person returned to say that Resorts approved my card and everything was all set.  At that point I had given her a generous tip because I knew it was not her fault, but rather poor training.  I had  finished my after dinner drink during the long wait and made a comment that the restaurant should buy me another drink, at which point the wait person walked away never to be seen again.  It was not a good experience and I will not be returning back to MJ Steakhouse anytime soon."
02/16/2020,Diner,5.0,"We had a 50th birthday celebration for two of our friends tonight. Dinner was fabulous. Amazing food, drinks and service by Ryan.  Thank you for a great evening!"
02/16/2020,EdAdams,5.0,"Excellent food at typical steakhouse prices.  The service was extraordinary.  They accommodated our multiple allergies with ease which made it a very comfortable situation. The server was also very helpful with suggestions on preferred temperatures on the cuts of meat.

02/15/2020,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food was great and the service was awesome. Jimmy and Carlos made our dinner experience fantastic
02/15/2020,Chip,5.0,"Everything was outstanding on Valentine's Day.  Hadn't been there in quite some time.  The food, the service and the fact that reservations were still being taken for 11pm and beyond was great because my fiancee doesn't get out of work until 10pm.  However, even as good as it was, the prices are a little out of sync for the amount of food that is being served.  Quality is great, prices a little excessive tho.. Can go to other steakhouses on the same level and pay less.  My only complaint.  A couple really shouldn't have to spend $250 for dinner and 2 drinks a piece.."
02/15/2020,marisola,5.0,Food was good service excellent

Made a reservation for 9 pm and when we arrived we were greated with a smile and promptly seated. I believe our servers name was Heather (it was a long night I apologize if I got it wrong, nonetheless she was lovely) she was fantastic  and attentive. We started with the garlic bread appetizer which is a must have! Split a wedge salad which was amazing. My husband had the braised short ribs and I the Ahi tuna, both will have us heading back soon. I cannot forget the Mac and cheese this is important. I could literally eat this everyday of my life. Creamy, deliciousness. Thanks for a wonderful experience."
02/15/2020,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Outstanding per usual

The steaks were predictably excellent, cooked to perfection. We could easily have filled up on their to -die- for garlic bread appetizer."
02/14/2020,KimberlyH,5.0,The food and service was incredible! Extremely satisfied.
02/13/2020,MsQuin,5.0,"Very high end steakhouse with an incredible staff to boot. I dined here solo and was treated exceptionally well by the staff! My first encounter with the hostess was very pleasant and I was shown immediately to my table. Shortly after I was seated, Jennifer introduced herself followed by the Assistant GM Dallas. Throughout my dinner, I learned a lot about the company from their experience and I really appreciated that the employees at this particular location seem to have a lot of tenure; Jennifer has been there for 13 years and Ryan for 20 years, and Dallas has been in the service industry for many years, which speaks a lot to the company, their treatment of their employees and from the crowd, it seems they have a consistent clientele. 

The menu offered several mouth watering options, but there were so many rave reviews about the jumbo crab cake and the garlic bread that I could not ignore them. Ryan, my food runner made a point to explain that the only breading on the crab cake is a thin layer on top and literally the rest of the crab cake is just meat! I have to say this is the BEST crab cake I have ever had. I also had a side of the broccolini/caulilini and it was a perfect compliment. Although I was full, I had to make room for dessert and went for the 23 layer chocolate cake and all I have to say is whoa.
The wine list is impeccable, the food was worth every penny and calorie and the service was just phenomenal.
Thank you for a wonderful evening!"
02/13/2020,Maegan,5.0,"The food was excellent, service was prompt and my boyfriend and I had an amazing time for Valentines Day!"
02/13/2020,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Excellent meal! Went for my boyfriends bday and requested a cozy table, got one of their cozy booths that allow for tons of privacy, definitely ask for one if you can. Food was outstanding and service was topnotch. We both were dying over the blue cheese fondue garlic bread"
02/11/2020,OpenTable,5.0,"Wouldn't be a trip to Mohegan Sun, if we didnt have dinner here. Always a great meal and service. Our waiter was attentive and always around. On our bill, the price of wine was incorrect, and not in our favor. We brought to their attention, and it was fixed immediately. Always top notch service."

02/09/2020,RussellC,4.0,Appetizers and entree were delicious. Jen our server was fantastic. The only downside was the 23 layer chocolate cake. It was obviously frozen and then thawed. Quality could have been much better there
02/08/2020,DennisM,3.0,"The $50 filet was very salty. I expected a much better steak for the price. The waitress was very accommodating, but in the end I was highly disappointed."
02/08/2020,BillM,5.0,"The service is outstanding, the food well prepared and presented.  The staff is very attentive.  The only distraction is the noise level.  Not conducive to an intimate conversation."
02/08/2020,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"We have porterhouse for two. It is suppose to be aged, it is tasteless. The portion size is small for two. Over price for the quality and quantity. I would not go back again."

We will be back."

02/01/2020,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"65th Birthday 

We were seated on top of a young couple in the middle of noise and chaos! Asked for another location since it was a special dinner.  Moved us near a service station.. very poor care for a very expensive dinner that included an $11 baked potato that was prepared, refrigerated and warmed up to serve! Nasty at this price!!! Very disappointed after spending over $200 for a very special birthday dinner!!!"
02/01/2020,KarenP,3.0,"This place is soooo overpriced! While the garlic bread with the blue cheese fondue was definitely a home run, the Caesar salad was so peppery it was hard to get through. The steaks were good but very salty. We definitely weren’t impressed with the trio of mashed potatoes, the classic were just ok, the bacon Gouda were good but again very salty, and the lobster mashed were way too seafoody tasting, like they added seafood base to them, yuck, we couldn’t even eat them! And the heirloom carrots were totally overpowered by the ginger glaze it was waaayyy too much ginger, a little goes a long way! Overall we were definitely not impressed.  I would recommend taking a trip up route 2 to Glastonbury and dining at j Gilbert’s."
01/31/2020,DebbieP,5.0,Have eaten there several times and the food this time wasn't what we normally expect.  The crab legs where too watery and the asparagus were undercooked.
01/30/2020,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Went to take my partner for a date night and he loves steak and I am a pescatarian and I was able to have many choices as their was a vegan menu as well. I was satisfied with service and food. The best part was noise level was low. Great overall experience.

01/26/2020,KennyE,5.0,"The food is great and the price is ok ............,.,"
01/25/2020,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Was a little disappointed that I made my reservation one month in advance and was given the worst table in the restaurant, in a corner near an open door that appeared to be a back alley of some sort?
All night long servers were in and out getting extra chairs and literally had to lift them over their head as to not touch us , it was quite annoying trying to have a nice dinner and have this go on through our entire meal .
To make matters worse 3/4 through our meal one server ( not ours) said “ has that door been open all night ? It shouldn’t be “
We said yes and it still wasn’t closed until we asked for it to be closed by another server , now knowing that it didn’t have to be open .

A cold draft was coming through as well,  2 tables next to us seemed bothered and chilly as well.
Food was great and server was outstanding !!!
If I go back I would never sit in that room again."
01/25/2020,MariaS,4.0,Everything was good but very noisy and the bathroom location very inconvenient to try go through all the people blocking the entrance other than that was good

01/22/2020,Vicki,3.0,"I hate going to a steakhouse only to find they don’t know how to cook a steak.  I ordered a filet well done and it was not only pink inside, but dried out, fatty and tough.  Many restaurants think people who order their steak well done kill it so giving them a less favorable cut will not be noticed.  There was no hope for this steak so I ate around the edges and didn’t send it back.  When I do send it back, my party eats without me and then my food comes and they watch me eat.  Unfortunately, getting a steak at restaurant well done is not always easy.  However, there should be no issues with this request from a steakhouse. The side dishes and dessert was great.  My guest had the same steak but ordered hers medium rare and she said it was great."

01/19/2020,MonicaB,5.0,The Manager checked in with us several times.  The food was phenomenal!
01/19/2020,JohnK,2.0,"The servers were polite, but it was VERY slow.  We sat for 10 min before we were even asked if we wanted water or drinks.  It was another 10 min before water came.  Food service very slow, quality nothing great."
01/19/2020,Katie,5.0,Food was exceptional. Service was great. We loved Monique! Best bday ever.
01/18/2020,JenniferB,3.0,We were sat next to a table with 3 kids who started breaking things . lighting was  too dimly lit to even read the menu. Also this is not the highest class steak house.  Just another chain. Aka Michael Jordans. Maybe not sitting us next to a kids table would have helped.  My filet mignon was good but not perfect. I will say our waiter was great and very knowledgeable of menu ( as he should be )   overpriced and was not wowed
01/18/2020,DianeD,5.0,Wonderful dinner and stellar service!
01/18/2020,StephanieM,5.0,Jimmy did a great job. I went with my girlfriend and we both agree that his attentiveness and personality added to our fantastic experience. Of course the food was beyond amazing. We’ll go back again
01/18/2020,Mrandi,3.0,"Food was good. Had good time. But what ruined it for us was the servers trying to rip us off!

There were four of us and ordered steak flights, sides, etc... so we ordered the smaller tower. This was clear as we discussed with the waiter. No mistaking what we wanted and ordered. When it came we sad stop, we ordered the small tower. Don’t recall the name. The bus person dropping it off said it’s safe thing. Then we pulled the server over and she said”same thing”. But when bill came we were charged for the $199 tower instead of the $99 tower. The clear and deliberate way they tried to rip us off really said a lot about the staff and they way they treat customers."
01/17/2020,CeceS,5.0,Fabulous meal! Outstanding service.  Especially impressed by the extra care they took accommodating my sons severe food allergy
01/15/2020,OpenTable Diner,5.0,One of the best dinners in birthdays I’ve ever had the place was phenomenal
01/13/2020,SusanS,5.0,"Danielle, our server, was exceptional!  We were there to celebrate our friends 59th Anniversary and she made their experience wonderful. The food was great, too !"
01/13/2020,RosannaG,5.0,Delicious steak and mashed potato trio...very pricey. Service excellent.
01/12/2020,LeighCooper,5.0,Outstanding service!
01/12/2020,Ballzgotw8,2.0,Our server Jimmy was great. Energetic & on top of everything. The drinks were good. Unfortunately the food was very mediocre & definitely not worth the price.
01/12/2020,Vanessa1,5.0,Great atmosphere. Wonderful staff and the food is absolutely amazing!
01/12/2020,Marybeth,5.0,Dinner was amazing!  Michael Jordan's never fails to impress from their wine list to their amazing food.  We went for my husband's birthday and they made it very special boy wishing him a happy birthday as we arrived to a candle in his after dinner cheese cake.  I had the rib eye which was absolutely wonderful and my husband had the special which was a 10 oz filet with lobster and scampi butter with 3 bacon wrapped scallops.  So delicious!  We will be back again soon!
01/11/2020,BigMac,3.0,"Not really a top tier ""Steakhouse"". Porterhouse for two - good not amazing.
Crab cake app was best we ever had.  Brussels sprout side overcooked and mushy.
Ambiance - tables packed way too close and noise levels off the chart."
01/11/2020,TomC,4.0,"If your looking for melt in your mouth steak, this is the place to go. Great Food, Great Service, a little expensive@"
01/11/2020,Ginnieny,5.0,Great service. Food was cooked to perfection. Everything was great!
01/11/2020,MichaelB,4.0,"The Shrimp Cocktail was good size, but it was kind of tough and chewy."
01/11/2020,JCOREA,5.0,Everything was fantastic! Jimmy is amazing and we love to see him every time. He never disappoints!!
01/11/2020,ProfessaS,5.0,The food was outstanding and the service was tremendous.  They treated my son and I like kings!
01/08/2020,Chrissy,4.0,All four of us enjoyed our entrees. Steak and pork  chops were excellent as well as the shrimp with scallops! Wish that there was more of a selection for me that doesn’t like beef.
01/07/2020,LouLou,3.0,"Terribly overpriced for what is offered. We have been to the best steak houses in NYC & across the country, and this doesn't come close. Given this, I would have rated it higher had the prices been commensurate with the quality. But $72 (plus $2 for cast iron cooked) for a mediocre ribeye is shameful. Not to mention this prime cut was covered in SEASONING that tasted like Old Bays. Speaking of Old Bays, the $15 lobster and crab bisque would have been delightful had it not been overwhelmed by a generous dumping of Old Bays. The $36 organic salmon was salty, but very good. Typically would be priced between $28-$30 @ a good restaurant. Brussels sprouts and mac n cheese were on point. $17 for Basil Hayden on the rocks also a little pricey. Good for a 1-time dine. Will not be returning. Tuscany and Ballo are far better choices."
01/07/2020,Sugarmuffin,5.0,"The food is always good and service is friendly.   The manager on the premises was particularly attentive, which was very nice."
01/06/2020,gailm,2.0,"We were looking forward to returning to Michael Jordan's for dinner but found the experience less positive this time.  First, the restaurant is very dark and the menu is impossible to read withoiut a flashlight on the phone (be prepared).  The waitress was good but after listening to the waiter at the table next to us, we realized she had not told us about specials or helped us consider options for the steaks we ordered (nto very good at upselling FYI management).  The food while good was not as memorable as the prior visits we made.   The steaks are fine but I have found them better at other steak houses.  The hostess' were fairly rude and we were ignored whle sitting in the bar area waiting for our table.  overall, fine food but not worth the money."
01/05/2020,LaurenT,5.0,I went with my boyfriend and we had an amazing time at Micheal Jordan’s Steak house. Our drinks were amazing were so good and our steaks were perfection! Will definitely be going back in the future.
01/04/2020,Kristen,1.0,Very disappointing. Not worth the money.
01/04/2020,MarinaS,5.0,"Service and food were excellent!!! Noise level was exciting. Perfect for us, but probably not the best for a romantic dinner out. Overall, outstanding."
01/04/2020,BonnieK,5.0,I have been to MJs a few times and recommend it after visit! Never a bad thing to say
01/04/2020,marisola,5.0,Great time food was good as usual dessert options could be better
01/02/2020,JeffreyB,5.0,Garlic bread app is amazing! My wife and I come here every time we are at mohegan. We usually Split the porterhouse for two and are always satisfied!
01/02/2020,MackenzieJ,2.0,"My husband and I went here to celebrate our anniversary. He loves steakhouses and we were very excited to try Michael Jordan’s. Unfortunately the experience did not live up to our expectations. The bisque was lukewarm but the crab and lobster was super hot, making me think the bisque had been sitting out and just had some hot fish thrown into it. The beef tartare was mediocre. We ordered the Steakmanship Series Legendary Flight, which was over $200, but what was advertised as Wagu Beef was definitely not wagu. The lobster tail was cold (it was not supposed to be) and all around the food was lackluster. If you are looking for a good steakhouse in New England, Fred and Steve’s in Rhode Island is a much better choice."
01/01/2020,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"NYE 🎉
Service- awesome 
Food- great
Ambiance- super cool!"

01/01/2020,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Food was absolutely amazing! Especially the crab cake and the pork chop!
01/01/2020,ANGELOY,5.0,"My wife and I come here every year for New Year’s Eve, we have never been disappointed"
12/31/2019,BrandonC,5.0,Our meals were both delicious. Our server Jimmy was great too
12/31/2019,FrankieBoy,5.0,Best Restaurant at Mohegan Sun. Steak was especially flavorful and a nice size. Side dishes enough for two people. Outstanding service. Outstanding food. As can be expected it is expensive but worth it.
12/31/2019,StevenL,5.0,I go every time I visit Mohegan Sun!  Service is always excellent!  The food is always amazing - the filet and lobster tail is to die for - my fiancee loves the 23 layer cake!!!
12/31/2019,Anonymous,5.0,The food was excellent and the wait staff was very good.  The normal ambiance was disrupted by music coming from outside of the restaurant.
12/31/2019,Carolynn,5.0,"Jimmy, our server, was great.  Full of energy and enthusiasm.  Food was so delicious it melted in your mouth.  My son and I stopped by on our way home from vacation.  What a wonderful way to end a wonderful time together."
12/30/2019,Leeb331,5.0,"The food and service was excellent. Steaks, salad, short ribs, excellent. Trio mashed potatoes excellent!  Try the garlic bread as an appy,  sauce is really tasty. We had the pleasure of having Ryan LaPorte as our waiter, outstanding service.  Yas was the asst. manager that night and was hands-on during our  dinner making sure everything was the way we ordered. Thomas Timmons, manager, gave outstanding attention to detail before and during our dinner as well. He made sure everything was perfect.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to everyone traveling to Moghean Sun. Food, service, way above what we ever expected.  Thank you again to all for the wonderful evening. 
PS.  If you are lucky enough to be there when Ryan L. is, ask if you can be seated in Ryan LaPorte's section, he is outstanding."
12/30/2019,CarterL,1.0,Always loved MJ’s food was just the quality it had been in the past...disappointing
12/29/2019,TreLa,4.0,"We were immediately greeted by the hostesses when we arrived and sat strategically in the rear of the establishment to offer a more private dining experience. Both the food and service here were outstanding. We chose the ""Flight 23"" from their Steakmanship Series menu as our meal for the night. It included a 7 oz. hand-cut filet mignon, 12 oz. Mishima Ranch domestic Wagyu strip, 16 oz. dry-aged prime Delmonico ribeye. All three steaks were cooked to perfection! The Wagyu was our favorite, but all three were outstanding. The overall experience was great, although it was mostly due to the extremely attentive staff (Thanks to Brian!) and the chefs that evening. The only rub, and it's not a big one, is for prices being on par with a Mastro's or Smith and Wollensky, you would not expect to encounter people in sweatpants and hoodies."
12/29/2019,TracyM,1.0,"I come to your restaurant 3 to 4 times a year and by far this was the worst service and food I ever had. Took forever for waitress to come over, then steak was served rare and cold when it was supposed to be medium well. Sent it back and came back no better. Sorry to say I will not be back."
12/28/2019,GinaK,5.0,Good and service was amazing! Our favorite restaurant.
12/28/2019,LindaM,4.0,Food was excellent however I found it over priced. I requested lemons for my water twice and never received them. We ordered one chopped salad and got 2 and charged for two. The waiter brought the bill but never brought us our leftovers to bring home. Disappointed
12/27/2019,KANYE,5.0,Great place but food did not come out hot! Disappointed especially for the price
12/26/2019,Stephany,5.0,Best ribeye I've ever had. Amazing bread. Great meal!
12/26/2019,Leslie,3.0,"We love Michael Jordan’s, we were so disappointed as they were completely out of bread.  How does a steak house run out of bread.  400 dollar dinner and not a piece of bread very very disappointed."
12/24/2019,PaulC,5.0,Good food and good service. Will go again when down at the casino
12/22/2019,Jodocs,5.0,Birthday 21 yo son
12/21/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Waiter was very helpful and attentive. Food was cooked perfectly.
12/16/2019,TommyZ,5.0,Chris the waiter was very   attentive we’ve had him before he is definitely on his game and you should be proud of him.
12/16/2019,TamikaS,4.0,Each time I come they change up the king Crab Legs (my fave). This time there was some brown sauce on them.  I did NOT like the sauce at all. I was told it was a tomato paste with garlic- tasted like barbecue sauce. Waitress did offer to make them over but I didn’t want to wait.
12/15/2019,MikefromMaine,5.0,Michael Jordan's Steak House at Mohegan Sun is always amazing.  The food and drinks are of the highest quality.  The service is excellent and all attention to details is over the top.
12/15/2019,EricW,4.0,Overall pleasant experience but steak was overcooked. Was late and added people to my reservation which they accommodated which was great
12/15/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food and service were phenomenal.

12/14/2019,AMKT,5.0,Really the best meal in the area!
12/13/2019,JeanL,5.0,"Although the food at Michael Jordan’s is exceptional, we find the bar products to be sub par and the price to be exorbitant on the drinks.  21.00 for a very basic Cosmo martini is outrageous."
12/13/2019,Kath,5.0,"My petite filet was cooked perfectly. Mashed trio was delicious, as were the other sides. Ended with a double espresso with 3 liqueres, yum."
12/13/2019,Loulou,5.0,We had a college reunion party. I find Michael Jordans Service I was impeccable. The stakes are always high-end quality.
12/13/2019,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Food was sub par, took over 45 min to get and was warm, not hot when we received it. We were attending a concert so couldn’t wait longer, ended up being 40 min late to concert bc service was so slow. Reservation was at 7, didn’t leave restaurant until 838pm"
12/10/2019,SusanS,5.0,Ryan our server was good. He made our dinner enjoyable.
12/08/2019,nicjay,4.0,unfortunately both my steak and my husbands steak was cooked wrong..we both asked for medium rare and mine was rare and his was medium... other wise it was a great experience...
12/08/2019,Kyle,5.0,MJs is top notch service and quality.  Our sever Jimmy was the best server I’ve ever had there and would highly recommend asking to be seated in his area.  The whole experience was fantastic and we will definitely be back again!
12/08/2019,SaritaB,5.0,"Great food, ambiance, service.  Would definitely come back"
12/08/2019,NIGHTOUT,4.0,"Our dining experience at Michael Jordan's was very enjoyable.  Service was impeccable, our dinner was delicious and perfectly cooked to our liking.  We didn't feel rushed, we were overall very impressed and happy a surprise bottle of wine sent as a birthday gift from our son, went without a hitch!  Definitely look forward to returning and would highly recommend."
12/07/2019,TimC,5.0,Awesome as always
12/07/2019,DeniseC,5.0,"Anyone looking for a wonderful dining experience, weather just dinner with family or friends or a special occasion, you can't go wrong dining at Michael Jordan's. Everything is Class A, from greetings to service, to food, to finish.  I highly recommend this place."
12/07/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Always a great dining experience!
12/07/2019,ThomasM,5.0,I had the flight 23 and it was unbelievable! The food was cooked exactly how we ordered it!
12/06/2019,WineGal6,4.0,"Delicious food and the service was excellent (thank you Julie).  Didn’t like the back room that we were sat in, felt  as though we were in the back corner.  There was no music playing and we could only hear the other guests conversations ."
12/06/2019,JoeU,4.0,Food was excellent and wait staff was pleasant and there whenever needed. Great time
12/06/2019,Brianne,5.0,"Food, Atmosphere,People - all amazing!  will return soon:)"
11/30/2019,CarolD,4.0,"A fine selection of high end steaks, chops, and fish in an energetic (noisy) atmosphere.  My husband opted for the filet topped with lobster, served with 3 large bacon-wrapped scallops and could not finish.  It was a decadent meal!  I had the pork chop and it was the first time I've ever ordered pork that was prepared to my liking (not under-cooked).  It was my birthday and I should have specifically requested a booth, but the table against the windows was fine.  We would definitely return because of the variety of dishes offered, along with many scrumptious salads and side dishes.  Perfect to celebrate an occasion!"
11/30/2019,MookieChookie,1.0,"besides almost seeing a women choke to her death, the steak was the absolute most disgusting thing I have ever tasted. We sent back the aged prime rib and was told it was supposed to taste like that.... but honestly it tasted like spoiled disease. The filet was not great either. I don’t understand what is going on here. The dessert cake was horrible too.

Good apps and sides, nice waitstaff. 

Overall a very disappointing experience. Should’ve went for Italian-!"
11/30/2019,MikeV,2.0,Server was non-existent.  Food was cold by the time it was brought out.  My steak was overcooked.  Definitely not worth the price.
11/28/2019,Steeltowngirl,4.0,"We love Michael Jordan's,  the first time we were there for of our Anniversary and it was perfect.  The Thanksgiving dinner was excellent except for the noise, there was a table behind us that was obnoxiously loud, they were drunk, there were 6 people all very loud, I feel that behavior like that should have been in the bar area not with people that want some peace and quite and be thankful for their blessings, with their families. Our meal was excellent, our waiter was supreme, our dessert was to die for, so my only issues were the loud people behind us.  We will be back, for we love fine dinning, and the great food."
11/28/2019,Caroln,5.0,"2nd year in a row for Thanksgiving. My daughter always gets the lobster and loves the sides. Service is really great. They all bend over backwards to make your experience really nice. Again the colossal jumbo size shrimp were tough. I think it’s because they are just too big. Maybe go with a slightly smaller size and give us 5 or 6 instead of 4 for $22.00.  Next year will order one of the other dozen salads or apps on the menu instead.  Traditional Thanksgiving dinner was absolutely delicious, my daughters lobster was perfect.  Definitely go again next year."
11/28/2019,jennifers,5.0,Always the best food. The wait staff is always friendly and attentive.
11/27/2019,marionc,5.0,"Wish I had been there on Thanksgiving too. Went to Bobby Flay's and was so disappointed.
I'm going home and cooking a turkey.

Our waiter was exceptionally wonderful and attentive. Great service."
11/24/2019,Skullster,5.0,"Excellent food and service!  Best filet steaks and short ribs around!
Deelish!"
11/24/2019,JamieL,3.0,"Side dishes were cold,and actually tasteless, steak was average..for this price everything needs to be on point"
11/24/2019,tymelyron,4.0,"Great garlic bread and blue cheese fondue for appetizer, enjoyed our filets, very tender,  but they should have been served hot, not lukewarm. Service was friendly and most efficient, despite large Saturday night crowd. Make reservations well in advance as there was a two hour wait for dinner without one."
11/23/2019,RICHARDMc,2.0,Steak was dry and overcooked. They sent out a new one but dinner was slready ruined
11/23/2019,brandonb,5.0,Great food better service
11/23/2019,BettyL,3.0,My wife ordered Alaskan King Crab legs that smelled and tasted very fishy. I traded her for my filet mignon. This was her birthday 🎂 celebration which made it disappointing! Noise level was extremely high!
11/23/2019,BobC,5.0,Always perfect and the best place for me when I entertain clients.
11/23/2019,JoeO,4.0,"Great food, good service.  The host told OpenTable that we didn’t show up for our reservation and the restaurant was very loud."
11/22/2019,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Not as good as it used to be. Hopefully it was due to a very busy night. I found the quality of meat was mediocre at best and i eat at steakhouses quite often.
11/21/2019,NathanS,5.0,Steaks were cooked to perfection and the service was top notch. We were lucky and got seated in the back of the restaurant and I very quiet table. Was perfect for my wife's birthday dinner.
11/18/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Phenomenal from top to bottom best steak house in CT
11/17/2019,JudithB,5.0,Spectacular in every way!
11/17/2019,RobertS,5.0,"Excellent steakhouse!!! Food was amazing! My fiance and I had the porterhouse steak for two and the filet mignon side of it was so tender it cut like butter! The garlic bread was like nothing I've ever tasted before and was incredible with the blue cheese sauce... Its not cheap, but you won't be disappointed! DEFINITELY recommend for a nice date night out or for a special occasion! Certainly a winner in my book!!"
11/17/2019,paulc,5.0,Waiter was great. Food was great!
11/17/2019,Leyla,4.0,One of the best meals I had there!  The Kansas City strip steak was the best steak I have ever had!
11/17/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The waitress was awesome. Great personality and super helpful with the menu. The 45 day dry aged ribeye was exactly what I was looking for and was cooked to perfection. One of my favorite places to eat at Mohegan.

11/16/2019,AlaneC,5.0,"Wonderful food, great service but difficult for conversation due to the noise level.  I will definitely return!"
11/16/2019,DiscoDoll,4.0,"The service has always been very good on my last 3 visits.  Our server Nancy on the 11/16/19 visit was exceptional.  She was friendly and professional.  The menu is not that elaborate  and for these prices the steaks should have a side INCLYDED in the price of the entrée....not ala carte.  Table for two on the small side, can't accommodate our plates and drinks comfortably."
11/15/2019,AnneN,5.0,We had a reservation but chose a high top table near the window and it didn’t disappoint. Our server was Nancy and she and Mariah (I believe) were outstanding. We ordered petite filets cooked to perfection and sides. The potato and mushrooms were cooked to perfection. I would have like the broccolini to be cooke a little bit more but it was still good. The fresh rolls...were amazing and so flavorful as well. The Parmesan truffle crust was excellent and would get this every time. Looking forward to the next visit.
11/14/2019,ARTHURS,5.0,"We asked for and got a quiet booth.
We ordered our favorite steak, the NY strip and as usual, loved it 
Service very good!"
11/14/2019,SusanS,4.0,"Our evening was not as good as it has been in the past. Our server was not as attentive and the pork chop was meager. Tasty but not very big for the price. 
We will continue to patronize MJ Steakhouse in the hopes that it will be back to excellent next time."
11/13/2019,Jimbo,5.0,Very good - the service was outstanding- our waiter Chris K was great. The food was ok - had better steakhouse but not complaining.
11/12/2019,Tropical,5.0,This is the second time I eat there this year. Its a great managed restaurant and the best in that resort. The food was very good and the presentation is good too. The service was professional and quick. Friendly service  and all people work there show a great customer service. Price / value is good but not on the low price side. Overall a great steak house!
11/12/2019,PeterO,4.0,Great food....loved the garlic bread...porterhouse steak for two
11/11/2019,JeffreyM,5.0,Awesome food and great service. Best steak I ever had!!!!!!!
11/11/2019,jfd3,5.0,The staff was great. Attentive. Food awesome
11/10/2019,BobR,4.0,"As expected, a terrific meal.  Reservation honored timely and service friendly and attentive.  The porterhouse for two was done exactly as ordered, the baked potato was as big as a small watermelon!  The only disappointment was the creamed spinach.....and when the server saw that we didn't eat much of it, she removed it from the bill.  That was a classy move and much appreciated.  Will certainly be back."
11/10/2019,GHaC,3.0,"Two of our meals were overcooked.  We didn't send anything back because it was 2 out of 3. Shrimp was too hard,  and asked for medium steak and it came out well.  The pork chop was fabulous.  But our waiter was phenomenal. They should all be like him."
11/10/2019,NYCSuzyO,5.0,"This restaurant outdid itself great food, service, and ambiance will definitely be back"
11/10/2019,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Great food. Average service.
11/09/2019,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Steaks - 2 petite filets 1 med rare and the other was requested med well and was served medium- both were “chewy”.  Disappointing.
11/09/2019,DavidI,3.0,Ordered delmonaco medium rare. Overcooked. Steak was charred. Would never go back. Won’t recommend. Very disappointed.
11/09/2019,Leeb331,3.0,"Walking into the restaurant, the ambiance was lovely, noisy but nice.  We informed our waitress that we would be going to the show so she would process our orders quickly. We ordered king crab legs that were to be brought with our meal but instead they were brought to us sooner. They were ice cold and the drawn butter was cold as well.They were more like snow crab then king crab, not worth the money that's for sure.Filet was ok, nothing outstanding. Had a seasoning on it that I really didn't care for. Our service was really below par for it being a steak house. We totally understood its busy but when then is a show going on they should have more servers. For the money that it cost it was not worth it."
11/09/2019,AlisyaM,5.0,The garlic bread with blue cheese dip is not to be missed! My signature Delmonico steak was cooked to perfection. Really enjoyable evening.
11/08/2019,Greg,5.0,"Chris K was a great server, friendly and helpful. Service was prompt and timely. Food was excellent. Garlic bread appetizer was amazing."

11/02/2019,RonR,5.0,Overall experience was without a doubt best meal and service of my life !
11/02/2019,jrd300,4.0,"over all the night was very good , excellent service , food was very tasty and cooked as ordered 
however eating at a steakhouse on many occasions and ordering the Porterhouse for 2 this was by far the smallest portion I have ever received and did not warrant a 96.00 price tag , our after dinner drink which was nothing more than a fancy irish coffee was very good .. but again 20.00 for a drink is just uncalled for .. I get it you are at the casino but at least make it worth while"
11/02/2019,Loveygourmet,5.0,"A great chophouse.  Loved the options from appetizers to dessert.  We had requested on our reservation for a table that was near a window and somewhat quiet and they gave us exactly what we asked for.   The triple threat? was a variety of 3 of their top appetizers: crab cake, glazed bacon and garlic bread with blue cheese dip.  Oh so good.  We then decided on the steak series which included Waygu, Delmonico and Fliet Mignon.  OMG--it comes sliced on a board with a variety of sauces on the side.  Cooked Med Rare to perfection.  All tender and tasty.  The Wagyu is the best steak Ive had.  Dessert the multi layered chocolate cake.  What's not to like?  Outstanding wines by the glass and half bottle too. Very large portions and of course there were leftovers.  Finally, a big shout out to our waiter, Chris K, who was phenomal.  Informative, funny, nice and down to earth.  His service was outstanding.  So happy we were fortunate to have him as our server.  Be prepared to spend big money.  But I can truly say you get what you pay for.  Go here if you want a very special dinner at the casino.  You will be very satisfied."
11/02/2019,MiaS,5.0,I ordered the Wagyu steak. Omg. It was like eating a fresh kill :). The meat was as a tender as a filet mignon. Deelish.
11/02/2019,VerySatisfied,5.0,"As always, the food was great, the service exemplary and the drinks were professionally concocted. Our twice-a-year get-together always culminates in a dinner at MJs. We have strayed in the past because of other people’s recommendations, but MJs has become our permanent site for the past 10 years."
11/01/2019,JustineC,5.0,Chris K always delivers on his service and recommendations. We went to Bobby Flays during our last casino visit and it only solidified why we come to MJ’s. Thank you for another great Date night!
11/01/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Everything was amazing, can’t wait to go back."
10/31/2019,transwood,3.0,The steak was cooked to order but wasn't as flavorful as in the past.  Also despite the fact we had reservations well in advance we were seated at an undesirable table in the back. We did get moved after complained.
10/30/2019,FRANK,4.0,"Steaks are outstanding, garlic bread can’t be beat anywhere else. Mushrooms not so great, they used to be  fantastic but very disappointed this time and the salad dressing on the chopped salad was almost tasteless"
10/30/2019,SaraW,5.0,Steak flight was delicious and a lot of fun to share. 23 layer cake was also great and fun to share
10/27/2019,ZickP,5.0,Amazing staff great atmosphere just all around great place to dine at

Food, wait staff (a shout-out to Jimmy)!, the manager was the Best!

10/25/2019,DianeV,5.0,Food and service was excellent! Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable.
10/22/2019,Richard,5.0,"The service was great. We did not wait very long for our apps or entree’s. We were asked a couple of times whether there were any allergies which was a good practice. The Manager on that night stopped by our table at least 3 times to ask how our meal was and he also met us as we were leaving for the night. Though the food was excellent as always, I thought the pricing was a little high. The wait staff and Manager did acknowledge it was my birthday which was great. Overall it was nice night."
10/22/2019,SteveK,5.0,Great server great manager always checked in on us! Thank you!
10/21/2019,Slix,5.0,"Michael Jordan's Steak House isn't cheap, but it's well worth the price. We were celebrating our anniversary, & not only received a verbal greeting & a card, but our server brought us a complimentary glass of Prosecco when we sat down. All of the food was amazing. My filet mignon was perfectly cooked and SO juicy and tender. Really unbelievable. My husband had the porterhouse steak and raved over his as well. My husband had oysters and I had steak tartare for our appetizers. Everything is á la carte, so we shared the mashed potato trio side--plenty for at least 3 people. The lobster mashed had lots of lobster in it, the regular mashed were very good, but the bacon smoked gouda was our favorite. Totally delicious. The baked Alaska I had for dessert made me want to lick the plate, but I managed to control myself. I highly recommend this restaurant. It blows Bobby Flay's American Bar out of the water. If it was closer to where I live, I'd be eating there all the time. Treat yourself. It's worth it."
10/20/2019,ErnestD,5.0,"Very noisy
Steak was ok...not the OMG my sirloin I was hoping for
Service... very good"
10/19/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"I reserved a booth which was extremely cozy, and while we could hear people, the booth canceled out much of the noise and felt very intimate. Our waiter was amazing and looked like one of the Baldwin brothers. When he would explain specials he made everything sound sooooo delicious! Dinner was on point. The roasted carrots, corn off the Cobb and steak were seasoned perfectly. My date ordered mussels and clams, and she absolutely loved the spicy seasoning sauce. Dessert was a slice of the 23 layer chocolate cake. And Oh my it was so delectable! Perfect 👌🏾We will head back soon! Michael Jordan’s Steakhouse made the evening just that much more perfect!"
10/19/2019,JLBM,5.0,"They gave us a 2 person table in the back of the restaurant, which was perfect.  Service was very attentive and helpful.  Food was delicious.  Love how they acknowledged my husband's b-day with sparkling wine and a candle on his dessert.  He was surprised."
10/19/2019,Sandy,5.0,Everything was amazing from the location of our seat to the card and complimentary champagne to celebrate our anniversary. The server was friendly and attentive and never pushed anything on us. I had a nice relaxing time. We ordered the surf and turf filet mignon and for dessert the goat cheese cheesecake and baked Alaska. The baked Alaska was my favorite!
10/19/2019,JENNIFERB,5.0,Our waiter knew everything. He made our experience better by picking the temperature of the meat.  It was the best dinner in a long time.  I recommend the steak flight.
10/19/2019,Kimc,5.0,Excellent service and food.! A little pricey but perfect for a special occasion!
10/19/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Went for my husband’s birthday.  Our server was wonderful!  She recommend a few great things on the menu and even brought champagne to celebrate!  Would definitely recommend!
10/19/2019,gungho,3.0,"The trio appetizer was excellent but that is where it ended.  The steaks were not at all what we expected for a high end steak restaurant. From the moment I tried to cut into the steak i could tell this was not the kind of steak I was expecting.  It was very tough and did not taste like a top of the line steak.  The sides were just ok - trio mashed potatoes, carrots and mushrooms.  So overall, very disappointed — and super expensive.  $250 without tip."
10/18/2019,JohnG,5.0,The food and service were fantastic. Always a great dining experience.
10/18/2019,DavidH,5.0,"Best steak in CT. Will  be back soon

Service always top notch."
10/17/2019,LEMM,3.0,Overpriced and slightly above average at best.
10/15/2019,Lori,2.0,"my experience was always great although the last couple of times not so much. We were there for our anniversary - my wifes meal was very good but my NY strip was tough nervy etc, the staff very accommodating want to make every thing right but unfortunately we could not eat at the same time which spoiled my entire evening. Im at a steak house and a steak may come out under or overcooked an easy and fast fix but cooking up a new steak which was offered but was taking way to long puts me at a different seating time than my wife -- not happy at all with that. I still walked out just paying under $300. and hungry for one meal and a lousy evening. I don't mind paying (that's why im there) but give me something worth it. My cell 631-831- 4075."
10/13/2019,KimberlyT,3.0,When did business casual include baseball hats and shorts? Was very disappointed. My family including my 14 year old dressed well (especially since it was his birthday dinner) and kids next to us running around their table ( in sweatpants) shining their phone light in our faces. I loved the food but would rather spend it in a place that holds their standards a lot higher. So if your looking for a very expensive casual restaurant this is the place for you!
10/13/2019,JamesB,5.0,"Overall excellent! Have visited before and loved the mashed potato trio. This time the Mac and cheese seemed to the the home run. The steak as usual was outstanding.  A little on the pricey side, but service, food quality and ambiance excelled.  Visiting for a twin birthday celebration and we're surprised with cake for the birthday twins!"
10/13/2019,Fareisfair,4.0,"Shared the Porterhouse for 2. It was excellent. Macaroni and cheese was also very good. The 23 layer chocolate cake looked impressive, but wasn’t anything special taste-wise."
10/13/2019,Flynnie34,5.0,We sat at the bar and the service was too notch. We enjoyed
10/13/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Delicious food. MJ Steak house always delivers.
10/12/2019,JamesK,5.0,Dinner before a show at the arena.
10/12/2019,MargaretG,2.0,"It was my husbands birthday the night I when to this restaurant and it was a shame because I was looking very forward to experiencing a great night but after everything was said and done I would not be able to recommend this to a friend, the drinks were good and the appetizers were good but as far as the service goes it was not great at all. Our food took a very long time to arrive after our appetizers and once everything did arrive our sides were cold and our steaks were overcooked, when the waiter asked if everything was fine I pointed out that our steaks were overcooked, she said I can see that and paused as if she did not know what to do she then said I can take it back for you but after waiting so long we were just inclined to not wait any longer and just try to eat it as is, she said she will let the manager know but he did not come for at least a half an hour after she told him and when he did he walked by us as if he did not want to stop and when he did he was not interactive at all and just stared at us and made my husband and I feel very uncomfortable. He had nothing to say to us but that if we decided to stay for dessert it will be on the house. This manager was just so unprofessional and did not know how to interact with his guests. Once our night was over and the bill arrived our dessert was not taken off at all or at least I was expecting to have the steaks reduced to at least half for coming out cold that we did not eat or a complementary drink on the house but nothing on their behalf, just a very disappointing night to say the least.  And this was a shame since my husband is a huge Michael Jordan fan and I wanted to make it night very special."
10/12/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great food and service
10/12/2019,Frambois,5.0,Best steaks and excellent sides. Really enjoyed our dinner. Celebrated our anniversary.

10/12/2019,DianeM,4.0,"Our first visit to MJ23’s restaurant @ Mohegan Sun.  The staff was exceptional by every measure,  from our greeting, to seating, to service.  We knew exactly what we wanted to order.   We ordered crab cakes as apps.  Both were delivered very “well done”.  Without hesitation, our waiter rooked them away with sincere apologies.  Once are apps
we’re replaced  and our Delmonico steaks served..dinner was amazing.  We particularly appreciated the Restaurant Manager personally checking in with us.  Will return."
10/11/2019,RP1966,5.0,"Great food, great service and very good wine list."
10/08/2019,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"I’ve been to MJ’s before and truly enjoyed. However, this visit, I found the food sub-par for the price. The shrimp cocktail sauce was virtually tasteless and the lamb a little tough (my brother-in-law makes better!) As always staff superb, knowledgeable and attentive. I may just dine at the Sports Bar next visit."
10/06/2019,Maria127,2.0,Spent $180 for 2 of us on our anniversary which I am not complaining about price been here plenty of times and always loved it what I was not happy with this time was food. I ordered bone in rib eye medium rare and there was no pink let alone red at all way to cooked and my husband ordered Kansas City also medium and again his was like shoe leather  very tough and very veinyz our Garlic’s bread had no sauce on it and no one ever brought it. Very disappointed I usually have a great experience here and at the pub. We go at least once a week but this time horrible!!!!
10/05/2019,1957CTdiner,5.0,Excellent meal and service! Our waiter was Bryan and he was attentive and prompt.
10/05/2019,GaryT,4.0,"Even though the menu and drinks are pricey, the quality of the food was excellent.  Everything was perfectly cooked and delicious.  However the only downside was that the restaurant was very crowded (all tables occupied), making it very noisy which took away from the ambience of having a nice romantic dinner."
10/05/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Food and service both excellent.  Ordered 2 filet mignons prepared medium..... one was perfect and the other overlooked, so asked the waiter what he thought, and he agreed.  Received another steak cooked perfectly within 2-3 minutes, so was able to enjoy the meal with my date instead of getting the replacement steak after the meal was over.  Brussels sprouts and mashed-potato-trio were both very tasty.  Noise level at this restaurant is always high, so be prepared for that, but otherwise a great meal!"
10/04/2019,MelissaD,5.0,Excellent Crabcakes and Truffle fries! Highly recommend this spot for a lively celebration or romantic dinner!
10/03/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"This was our 2nd. time dining here, and it was just as good this time as last. We received complimentary champagne for our 1 year wedding anniversary, what a nice surprise!!!"
10/03/2019,CTchris,3.0,"Signature garlic bread was burnt and in edible, portion was ridiculously small for entry. $200 for two with no drinks or desserts. This was the second time I have eaten in the restaurant, and both times I was not impressed. What a waist of time and money."

09/29/2019,MarcW,3.0,I ordered  a 12oz waygu strip. Had a fat vein running through the meat. Was super tough. The staff was great about it. The manager took it off the bill but I feel like they could have done a little more.

09/22/2019,TashaE,5.0,"Had the best birthday celebration dinner thanks to my husband and wonderful staff at Michael Jordan steakhouse. We had reservations and was seated immediately after we arrived. The server ""Ryan"" was friendly and professional. I ordered the seafood tower unfortunately they were out of lobster for the order but substituted with extra crab legs. Which was great!  My husband ordered the filet mignon and thought it was amazing. The overall quality of the meal was above quality and the ambience was just as inviting. We will definitely go back again. Very satisfied couple."
09/21/2019,Pro72,5.0,"Perfect Dinner. From start to finish all spot on. Apps...Had the Trio which includes MJ's Blue cheese Bread stack, Crab Cake and Bacon.

09/17/2019,Cardon,5.0,We’ve been to this restaurant because we always though it was much too expensive.  It was not and we will be back again.  Loved the bar area too.  Highly recommend if you are a steak lover.
09/17/2019,PinotS,5.0,The porterhouse for 2 is fantastic.  Cooked to temperature requested of medium rare.  The mashed potato trio is fun and delicious.  Staff was attentive and honored all of our requests.  Jordan's is one of our favorite places to dine at Mohegan Sun.
09/16/2019,DavidW,5.0,"I scheduled my dinner congruent with the restaurant opening because I wanted quiet and serenity;  as I correctly surmised the restaurant was virtually vacant at opening.  The food, especially the steak was excellent.  The ambiance was fantastic as well as the service."
09/15/2019,LeeRoi,5.0,"Our favorite restaurant at Mohegan! Jimmy was our server on Sunday night 9/15 and he was fantastic.

09/13/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Anniversary dinner. Staff was amazing. Gave us a anniversary card and glass of champagne to celebrate. Server knew the menu perfectly
09/13/2019,jmckjr,5.0,"We were greeted by our server Jimmy who was charming, funny and informative. We let him know we were not in a rush and wanted to relax over drinks for a while and he was very accommodating. Jimmy gave us the specials of the night and while he was doing that he squatted by the table so he was at eye level with us and we did not have to crane our necks to look at him as we listened.
I had the NY Strip and my wife had the Fillet. For sides we did the potato trio and the and the corn. The steaks were cook to perfection. My only complaint about the food was the size of the sides. There were only two of us but the sides would feed 4. 
Jimmy's partner Maranda stopped by to check to see how we were doing.
Jimmy and the wonderful food made for a memorable experience."
09/13/2019,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"Service was good.  Ambiance could use some work.  Seated quickly and food arrived quickly as well.  Started off with their garlic bread with blue cheese fondue, which set the bar high as it was delicious; unfortunately, it was down hill from there.  Martini was small and definitely not the best.  We had the Porterhouse for two and overall it was quite disappointing, very fatty and not presented well at all.  The potato trio was just ok.  The corn was the best part of the main meal.  We opted to skip dessert and go elsewhere.  We really couldn’t believe we spent so much on a meal neither of us really enjoyed."
09/11/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Birthday celebration for both my wife and me. Staff was incredible!!

09/08/2019,CarolB,5.0,We had an amazing Anniversary dinner!!! Complementary  champagne and our Server Nancy was so attenitive!! And her whole team worked so well together...
09/08/2019,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"My husband and I took another couple out to dinner as a thank you.  We ordered our dinners and the waitress was very good at explaining everything and answered all of our questions.  We each ordered steaks.  Three of us had Filet and one ordered a Delmonico steak.  When our dinners arrived I cut into my filet and I was having a hard time cutting through the steak due to fat and tendons.  It was cooked to the correct temperature, however a more than $50 steak should NOT be difficult to cut through. My friends Delmonico steak was nearly inedible.  The edges of the steak were so hard she couldn’t actually cut through them.  She had more than half of her steak chewed, but couldn’t swallow due to how tough the steak was.  Again, another more than $50 steak!  Very disappointing.  But what was more disappointing was the waitress never even asked if everything was ok - even with a good portion of both steaks sitting on each of our plates.  Not only that, but the manager had come to the table next to ours to deal with a customer that was cold, started to walk toward our table, saw the plates and basically b-lined in the opposite direction!  Not the way you’d expect to be treated in a restaurant such as Michael Jordan’s and after spending nearly $500.  I’m not a complainer - EVER, I never return anything- even if it’s not what I wanted.  Shame on me for not speaking up, however BIG shame on Michael Jordan’s for clearly seeing something was not right and NOT addressing it. We won’t be back!  My advice would be proceed with caution unless you are ok with spending a good deal of money on something you won’t enjoy!"
09/07/2019,MikeR,5.0,Awesome food great way to enjoy my 25 year anniversary with my wife we definitely be coming back with the kids next time
09/06/2019,MJBerry,5.0,"Our favorite restaurant by far!  Consistently excellent steaks and service.  They have a new chopped salad which was delicious!  Brian was an excellent waiter, very personable, friendly and helpful.  Not sure of the name of the guy who delivers the food, but he has been there for a long time and is great!  He always remembers us and makes nice comments about our selections.  If you are looking for the best steak you'll ever have, you will not be disappointed with MJs!  Highly recommend!!!!!"
09/05/2019,JohnS,5.0,As always everything was delicious and service was top notch very professional
09/04/2019,Jack,5.0,"Absolutely loved it. Had the 7oz filet, mashed potato side and the Boston Cream pie for dessert. Pricey but that’s understandable considering the location and the quality of the food. Filet was very tasty, mashed potatoes were great and the dessert was incredible. Rich and delicious. The jumpman logo is actually in the cake which was really cool. Then they cover it with some dark chocolate sauce. My bill came to $85 including tip (filet $42, potatoes side $14, dessert $11) however I did order much considering it was my first time and I wanted to try the potatoes and a dessert. Dessert was big enough for two people so it could be split. Same with the potatoes side. It was three different kinds of mashed potatoes (classic, lobster, bacon gouda) in a dish so definitely could be split amongst two people. Absolutely amazing place that I recommend. There is an attached cafe called “23SportCafe” and walking to the bathroom the wall is lined with framed photos and autographed MJ Sports Illustrated covers. Jordan is my all time favorite athlete so it was a thrill for me. The cafe also had framed jerseys on the wall and the tables had MJ statistics on them. The cafe menu also has a lot of options and is less expensive than the steakhouse. Great ambiance. There’s also a good wine list. Restaurant is a little noisy but that is to be expected as the casino is downstairs. Again, 5 stars and would definitely recommend."
09/02/2019,StephanieT,5.0,"The steak was really terrific- good quality and cooked to perfection!!!  I think the prices were a bit on the high side but we shared and it was more than enough for both of us with plenty left over.  The sides were uninspired, felt the ginger in the carrots was overwhelming and the asparagus were kind of puny.
The server was really excellent, very kind and accommodating, and the service itself was very good, food & drink brought out in a timely fashion and requests addressed immediately.  The environment was attractive and the noise level was fine, could hold a conversation and hear the other person speak.
Would recommend and also return!"

Salad...horrible
Salmon...undercooked

Filet....minuscule
Baked potato....undercooked


The worst part....we were hosting out of town guests for the first time there’b"
08/31/2019,AnidaM,5.0,My boyfriend and I had an amazing time. Food was great as well as the service. I had asked our waitress if they do anything for birthday celebration - in fact they do a complimentary slice of cake. I had gotten the double lamb chops with a side of crispy Brussel sprouts (amazing) and my boyfriend had got the NY Rib Eye Steak.
08/30/2019,GabbyD,2.0,"I used to love coming to this restaurant, I’m not sure what happened but it has gone way downhill. The hostess when we first walked in ignored us and was completely rude. Our waiter Ryan was fantastic very attentive and helpful. As for the food it was not good the porterhouse steak was so dry and flavorless. We were also seated in front of kitchen and every waiter hit our chairs each time they passed and never apologized. Unfortunately we won’t be returning."

08/24/2019,LisetteF,5.0,"Went for our anniversary and very happy with our pick, big steak eaters. Food I gave 4 stars because we didn’t love the garlic bread appetizer. The bread was stale. We ordered the 10oz filet, asparagus, and corn for entree. Delicious can’t describe how good it was. The steak melted in your mouth. Nice atmosphere, if I would’ve known I would’ve reserved a side booth, they looked cozy. Would definitely go back again"
08/24/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,One of the best steaks in a long time
08/24/2019,RuthV,4.0,The food and service was very good just way to loud and a little rushed
08/24/2019,JackT,5.0,Michael Jordan’s is a dining experience. Don’t go there without a very thick wallet!  It’s worth spending the high prices for excellent food & service on occasion. We have eaten there several times in the past few years and it never disappoints
08/23/2019,Froggy,5.0,Excellent meal
08/23/2019,BenHeidiY,5.0,Birthday and promotion celebration
08/23/2019,CathleenB,2.0,This visit was a disappointment.  Steak was very fatty and not as good as prior visits.  Consistency is key for a high end steak house.  Likely to go elsewhere next time.
08/23/2019,ChefCarols,5.0,"I took my mom to Michael Jordans' Steak House for her birthday.  With as many times as we have been to Mohegan Sun, it was our first time trying this restaurant.  All I can say is - what were we waiting for?!?  It was fabulous!  I wish we had been going all along.  The food and service we both absolutely outstanding.  The prices were obviously quite high, but the quality was definitely there to make it feel worthwhile.  The wine selection was great and our waitress offered amazing beverage and food recommendations.  We had  a cute booth that made us feel like we had a private space and that we were the only ones celebrating in this quite large restaurant.  While we will keep this restaurant on our list, the price range will make us save it for special occasions."
08/22/2019,JoeU,4.0,I would give it 5 all the way except that the  table next to us was extremely loud and one man was bragging about himself which we didn’t want to hear and secondly our waiter started out great but we did have a long wait for the bill. Other then that the food was great
08/22/2019,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Service and Food very good. Food came quickly. Very noisy but to be expected. All in all a great meal
08/21/2019,RichardW,5.0,Great service  waitress was awesome very intensive on point never had to wait for nothing walked in for my reservations the concierge’s was very tentative for   For my needs of service we had to go to a concert to the Jonas brothers said we had to be out by 730 our reservations were at 6:30 they expedited service to my needs  Extremely happy
08/21/2019,SamanthaW,4.0,"We enjoyed are time at the restaurant, food was good. Pricey but it’s the name"
08/19/2019,CesarSalad,5.0,Service is the best. Always pleasant and happy. They make you feel special. Food was very good.
08/18/2019,BARBIE,5.0,"I surprised my husband with a stay at Mohegan Sun for his 75th birthday, and a dinner at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse. The Steakhouse did not disappoint us. Two of our children joined us for the celebration. All of our meals were A++.

Nancy and Oscar were wonderful servers. Right there whenever we needed attention, and ready to answer any questions that we might have had.

We would definitely return again, and would highly recommend The Steakhouse to others."
08/18/2019,BronxFan,5.0,Best spot in Mohegan Sun.  The steak melts in your mouth.
08/18/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"This is a place that cares about service. Monique, our waitress was phenomenal. The crab cake was the best I ever had, however, the short rib pappardelle was less than to be desired. My husband had the petite filet mignon which was delicious. I’ve heard amazing things about the steak, so I regret choosing something else."
08/17/2019,dm204,5.0,We were celebrating my birthday. Very noisy in the restaurant making it difficult to have a conversation without shouting. Food arrived in a timely manner. The bisque was excellent.
08/17/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"My husband and I were on a weekend getaway and made reservations for dinner at MJSH. It is our go-to place, and once again it did not disappoint. Food and service were outstanding. It was pretty loud because their were a few large parties. All in all it was the quality we expected. We will be back!"
08/17/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellent food! Great atmosphere!
08/14/2019,JustinB,5.0,"Best steak I've ever had. Service was amazing. And it wasn't cheap, but didn't break the bank."
08/12/2019,LetsGoMets,5.0,"The steak tartare was outstanding!  I highly recommend the garlic bread and blue cheese fondue!!! My ribeye on the bone was cooked and seasoned perfectly! Our server LaPort was knowledgeable, pleasant, and you can truly tell he loves his craft!!"
08/11/2019,MichaelL,5.0,I do not know if energetic is a good explanation for the volume of the restaurant. It was noisier than one would expect.
08/11/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The food is always Awesome! I can’t imagine any one having a complaint. The service was top notch , Our server James & his assistant Mariya did a great job! They didn’t rush us at all but got us out in plenty on time for the show. We love MJ’s"
08/11/2019,AlysonH,4.0,"pro: good option at mohegan sun or in the area
con: you're still at mohegan sun 

my sister and i visited because we were staying at the norwich inn nearby and wanted a celebratory dinner. food and service were great. it's a bit overpriced for what and where it is."
08/11/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Always a great experience, and Shirley at the bar is incredible!"
08/10/2019,BgWarbs,4.0,Too LOUD to even have a conversation. Food was great. Service OUTSTANDING but they need noise dampening in there. Paying fine dining prices but no ambience so it feels like you’re at a buffet.
08/10/2019,KristianaL,5.0,"The food and the service were both amazing! The staff was very accommodating and our server was excellent. Great personality and on top of everything- food , drinks and clean up. It’s my second time there and this place does not disappoint!!!"
08/10/2019,pamelah,5.0,This truly was an amazing dinner with super attentive staff. The birthday champagne was delicious.. we couldn’t believe it took us so long to dine there. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.. we look forward to returning again.
08/10/2019,Baduch,5.0,"Good as hellllll! We had the filet, cream of spinach and mash potatoes. Was yummy to our tummies"

08/08/2019,MichelleL,4.0,Amazing steak and lobster!
08/04/2019,JacobP,5.0,"Was very delicious and even though it is expensive, the amount of food you receive and with the excellent service, it was well worth it. Can't wait to go back!"
08/04/2019,MarieG,5.0,The food and the service were exceptional.   I was pleasantly surprised for a glorified mall location.   We definitely we’re gluttonous!!
08/04/2019,OpenTable Diner,3.0,This was our second visit. Filet was cooked perfect. Side dishes were cool or luke warm. Service was decent.
08/04/2019,CarlG,2.0,The steak was extremely salty and the scallops were average at best. For a place that charges Peter Luger prices you would expect it to rival the taste but the was far less than what a good steak house can deliver.
08/04/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The best steak we ever had!!! Deelish
08/04/2019,MariaD,5.0,Luckily we were behind a column which made our evening a bit quieter as it buffered the noise.
08/04/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great meal and service as always!
08/03/2019,KenM,4.0,"Love MJ’s. Never a bad meal in 15 years. This last time was very good too. Only feedback was that Bryan was super slow, although very gracious; probably added 20-25 minutes to the meal.  Look forward to returning soon."
08/03/2019,JonK,5.0,Food was excellent our server Brian was terrific will definitely make a return appearance
08/02/2019,StefaniaS,4.0,We had a table for 2.  The tables on both sides of us were so close we could barely hear our conversation over the people next to us. Great service and great food.
08/02/2019,stevena,4.0,"The food was very good and very tasty,  but my wife and I felt there was too much flavor enhancer (MSG) or salt.  But besides that we enjoyed Dinner very much. We had Beef short rib and the mashed potatoes and the asparagus. If you would like to contact us feel free."
08/02/2019,BobC,5.0,"Always top notch service, food and atmosphere.  Best place to go at Mohegan Sun!"
08/02/2019,LynnR,4.0,Enjoyed the meal. Food is good-very rich.

07/29/2019,CreeC,5.0,Amazing experience with the best customer service! Highly recommend. Our dinner was out of this world!
07/27/2019,GaryT,4.0,"We have dined here several times and have never been disappointed.  The food is always good and delicious, but obviously on the expensive side, especially considering everything is a la carte."
07/27/2019,Gardenia,5.0,We had a wonderful evening at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse at Mohegan Sun! It was a little noisy but everything else was great. The food was outstanding and the service couldn't be beat!
07/27/2019,RichardF,5.0,AWESOME in every way!!!!!!!! What more can I say.........If steak is what you want. MJs is the place!!
07/26/2019,Brad,3.0,"Vegan Bolognese was excellent. Wife had a crab cake which she said tasted bad. Mac and cheese was sub par as well. Ordered a second drink which never showed up after about 20 minutes. To their credit, I ordered the drink from a third waiter who asked if I needed anything. He probably forgot or just didn’t care because it wasn’t his table. Was expecting a little better."
07/26/2019,ChrissyG,5.0,The food was amazing! Especially the garlic bread app and bacon app...filet mignon and huge baked potato!!!
07/26/2019,TimothyT,5.0,Fantastic as usual. Accommodated us with booth I requested and brought my wife champagne for her birthday. Well done and thank you.
07/26/2019,Ashee,3.0,Great service that’s about it! Apps have potential but that’s about it! They put some weird sauce on perfectly great crab legs & the lamb chops were the worst I ever had! Burnt what more can I say & serve it with a dissenter of a since called mint chimmichuri & since chickpea purée that just cane be defined it’s so weird! You can go to say you went but don’t order what I had please! I’m begging! In mohegan sun best restaurant overall for fine dining is TUSCANY
07/25/2019,ClaudiaB,5.0,Everytime we visit mohegan sun Michael Jordan's is the only restaurant  we like to dine
07/25/2019,johnd,5.0,"Great service, great experience ! the menu was great, as was the atmosphere. i will definitely be going back"
07/22/2019,TanyaB,5.0,"Fabulous food, service and ambiance, but its so dark in the place I had to use my phones flashlight to read the menu. It is pricey but the food was worth it."
07/21/2019,MSHOST,4.0,Everything was perfect
07/21/2019,MarcN,5.0,"As always, a perfectly prepared steak and sides.  Our server was great as well!"
07/20/2019,JeanL,5.0,Overall excellent experience-waiter did not ask if we wanted more drinks-besides that he wS excellent
07/20/2019,Superb,5.0,"This was my wife and my first time eating at a Michael Jordan Steak House.  We made a reservation in advance and were happy we did.  We arrive 45 minutes early thinking we may be able to sneak in early since we had tickets for a concert.  No such luck as the foyer near the hostess area was crowded with waiting customers.  We could see the restaurant was full with diners so understood this.  After a 10 minute wait at the bar, I was able to order two house cabernet wines....Delicious!  We were seated right at our reservation time and informed the waitress that we only had an hour before the concert.  We ordered immediately and took her suggestion of having our filets coated with a truffle parmesan mixture.  We also ordered the grilled corn, trio of mashed potatoes and lobster tails.  Everything was above and beyond delicious!  Service was exceptional, food was served quickly and quality impeccable.  Highly recommend this restaurant."
07/20/2019,NanaSS,5.0,Food and service excellent. Very pleased with both considering how busy the restaurant was. Going back in August with my family..
07/20/2019,AnneH,5.0,"One of the best steak houses I have ever been to.  Food, service, drinks, everything was great.  Unfortunately, the security at the arena, made me throw away my left over steak after our great waitress took the time to double wrap it in foil so I could put it in my purse.  I am dealing with that at the Mohegan Sun customer service level and if I don't get satisfaction there, I will take it to the CEO and the Board.
The restaurant is fabulous, however, and I would definitely go again and recommend it to others."
07/20/2019,Dean,5.0,"We had the best experience ever.  We don’t give outstanding ratings often,  but they deserve it and more.  Thanks to all employees that made this an excellent meal event."
07/20/2019,NickD,2.0,"The salads were great and my 14 oz rib eye was very good but my wife ordered tuna medium and it came well done and the carrots were not cooked
Meal was sent back and it took 20 minutes after my meal was over so we cancelled her dinner 
Sorry but we will not be returning"
07/20/2019,AminT,5.0,"I brought my girlfriend to Michael Jordans steakhouse for a little vacation away from home. And I can say with confidence that I will be back again. Jimmy our server was an absolutely amazing server. False. I wouldn’t call him a server. I’d call him an expert in steakmanship. He went above and beyond to insure that our time at the restaurant was an absolutely enjoyable one. Not only did jimmy take care of us, he also ensured that our dinner was breathtaking. I have not had steak that good in my entire life, nor have I had an experience like I had at Michael Jordan’s steakhouse. Thank you to Jimmy and and the incredible chefs at Michael Jordan’s steakhouse, for making our time one to remember."
07/19/2019,JakeG,4.0,If you stay at mohegan sun you need to go. The seafood tower is great.
07/19/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellent choice for a special occasion.  Everything was cooked to perfection.
07/19/2019,Jeannie,5.0,"Very good! Perfect filet.
Did not get my open table points? Why"
07/19/2019,2thdoc,4.0,"As in many casino restaurants, there is little space or privacy. One of the world's most annoying couples was seated next to us, otherwise this would have been an outstanding dining experience."
07/19/2019,DW22,5.0,"Nice restaurant great food, service was really good, would go back again. Little pricey but we expected that so wasn’t a huge surprise. Steaks were cooked perfectly. Sides are big enough to share."
07/19/2019,baseball,4.0,"Service - “Jimmy” and team was excellent. Food was as expected - delicious. As always, the noise level was so over the top that you couldn’t hear what people at your table were saying."
07/17/2019,JoanneB,4.0,Great food and service. Pricey. Very loud and no ambiance.
07/14/2019,TheRads,5.0,"Delightful, pub-type restaurant with good food and wonderful service.  Very eager to please.  The maître 'd overheard us saying it was too cold, and he came over to say he raised the thermostat.  I was with my daughter, celebrating her ""big"" birthday.  When I made res. I told them that.  After dinner a mini cake with candle was brought to the table, along with two flutes of champagne."
07/13/2019,DavidS,5.0,It was our anniversary and second year we spent there. They gave us a great table the service and of course the food was outstanding. We will be returning next year to celebrate our anniversary

07/13/2019,Tony,5.0,"Had a great time here with Chris as our server. Had the rib eye, Wagyu meatballs and a few Long Island's.

The lights were dim and the atmosphere was perfect for a date."
07/10/2019,katek,1.0,"I ordered a margarita and asked if they could make it a double, which they said no problem too. When the bill came, they charged me for 2 margaritas . If it is your policy to charge a double cocktail as two drinks, please inform your patrons."
07/07/2019,ScottB,5.0,"Truely a great meal, from water to desert, service was great and the meal was awesome."
07/07/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great food and service!    We have been going for the past 5 years!
07/07/2019,korzo,5.0,Anniversary
07/06/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,As always - food was great. I especially appreciated the steak au poivre special since before there weren’t many options for those who like a little spice with their steaks. We love the garlic bread and blue cheese fondue.
07/06/2019,Specialnov26,3.0,"This is not my first time to this restaurant but its def my last!! service was mediocre at best portion size very small for what I’m being charged...I stated in my reservation on open table that It’s my boyfriends bday and it’s our first bday together and wanted to make it extra special ... the hostess didn’t know they were going to put us at a table near kitchen until I said that  I wanted different table .
I don’t mind paying for good food and service especially that I’m in the service industry ... but this place not worth it and wouldn’t recommend it anymore"
07/06/2019,SharonG,5.0,"We sat at the bar and the three bartenders were outstanding!

Thank you, not to mention the food was great!"

07/05/2019,RICH,4.0,Had to send my wife’s filet back 2 times. Not like MJ’s. Everything else was excellent 😄😄
07/05/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The best steak ! Cooked perfectly ! Amazing service . Garlic bread was delicious.
07/04/2019,Billm,3.0,The food was good but service was slow and took too long.   Would not go back.
07/04/2019,JoeU,4.0,As usual the food was excellent for we have visited numerous times. But the service was a little slow this time for some reason.
07/04/2019,KevinD,5.0,Literally the best restaurant around
07/04/2019,Vinfrommadison,4.0,"The service from start to finish was horrible. The food served, once it got served was excellent. Service: 1. Took long time for server to take wine order. 
2. Wine we ordered was not available. 
3. Taking of food order took a while and then entree came before we finished salad. 
4. Had to get bus boy to get a manager to pay bill, waiter was no where to be found."
07/03/2019,Michael,5.0,"As usual our dinner was excellent.
     The service is second to none.  
      Third time dining there this week.
         Michael R"
07/02/2019,LLLKKK,2.0,Quality of meat for price was just ok.  Prices too too high.  Everything is ala carte for prices being so high.  Meat came out rare instead of medium rare.  Lobster mashed potatoes for $14 had no pieces of lobster in it and waiter could care less.  Service was poor.  Wanted to seat in dining room not bar area  host puts us right outside of bar area. until I told her to move us.  I would not recommend this place due to prices too high and everything ala carte.
07/02/2019,DebbieP,5.0,Amazing staff and excellent food.  Never disappoints.
07/01/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"It was amazing as usual. Excellent food, attentive wait staff and we celebrated our 1st anniversary with a champagne toast to boot!!"
06/30/2019,GiseleR,5.0,"our server, Chris, was great.  did an excellent job.  the food was fabulous!!  we will be back :)"
06/30/2019,CarolP,4.0,"Steaks were excellent as far as quality, both our steaks were too salty 
We got the trio mashed potatoe. The lobster and plain were delicious. The ones made with the cheese were very good also, but again too salty. We actually should have sent the steaks back, but chose not to.
Again the meat quality was excellent and the steaks were cooked perfectly to outmedium rare request.
Drinks very expensive"
06/30/2019,JohnS,5.0,Great place to eat. Food was excellent. Wait staff was best I have ever faced. Special thanks to LEE. He was outstanding. Price was a little high but quality of food made it a little easier to take. Would definitly go back.
06/30/2019,AshleyC,5.0,"The whole experience was phenomenal, would go back anytime."
06/29/2019,RobertB,5.0,"Fantastic food, and drink
Service was excellent
I’ll be back"
06/29/2019,Bree,5.0,"We usually stick closer to home and go to capital grille or Ruth’s, but we really enjoyed the dinner here. The steaks were amazing. The sides added a lot more variety and ingenuity. Will definitely go back!"
06/29/2019,Suzy,1.0,It was my birthday and besides the service it was not great. I was so disappointed because last year everything was phenomenal.
06/29/2019,KC23,2.0,"To say we were very disappointed with our experience on Friday night would be an understatement!  We were seated at the kitchen entrance on the busiest main isle in the restaurant, abutting the bar area.  It was hectic with wait/bus staff, hostess’ and customers whisking by our table.  My chair was literally bumped into several times by staff rushing by.  We asked to be moved and they moved us one table over off the isle.  Our waiter took our order and after we recieved our food, he never came by again to check in or see if we needed anything else.  Next time we saw him he was giving us our check.  We never even saw a bus person to refill our water glasses all night.  Our meal was good (porter house steak for two with the mashed trio and mushrooms), but for what it cost us.  I would have thought we would have had an outstanding meal/dining experience.  Instead, the atmosphere was terrible, being seated in the bar area near the kitchen entrance is unacceptable.  And the noise levels in that area are very distracting."
06/28/2019,SteveSwenson,4.0,As always the service is great food is very good. However as always the noise level is very high which is understandable due to the fact that the restaurant and bar are always full
06/28/2019,LoufromConnecticut,3.0,This isn't our first visit to Michael Jordan's Steak House but the quality of food this time did not live up to the price charged. The prices were comparable to Ruth's Chris or Peter Luger Steak House but not the quality or portions. The portion of your Salmon Dinner my son in law ordered was so small we ordered an additional one upon its arrival at our table. When the bill finally came I had to ask our server for a slip stating the actual charges for our dinner as all he brought was the $411.00 charge slip for signature. There were other issues too small to mention but added to the evenings disappointment.
06/28/2019,SalM,3.0,Didn’t think the steak was anything special good not outstanding as I think it should have been
06/28/2019,BarbaraT,3.0,The food is good and my waiter was good but the overall experience was not great.  They sat me in a “doorway” and although it was not a full house they packed us in like sardines-at one point I thought I was getting food spilled on me.  The service was also slow.
06/27/2019,Pro72,5.0,This is with out a doubt one of the best steakhouses in New England. Always consistent food and the service is great. Folks remember you here. Pricey but worth it. I'm working towards my personal Knife!! Always a must dinner when in town. Wish it was closer.
06/27/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Service was exceptional, and the food never disappoints. This is our go to for every date night or business dinner while at Mohegan Sun"
06/27/2019,RichardC,2.0,I was left very unimpressed by the whole experience. I have been to many steak houses and would not put the MJ restaurant at the top of the tear. In addition the restaurant was way too dark
06/27/2019,EinFalmouth,5.0,Great service. Bacon and garlic bread apps were excellent. Salads just good. Great pork chop and filet mignon.
06/27/2019,LarryS,5.0,Excellent steak and apps. Cooked perfectly. Service was wonderful.
06/26/2019,RICKF,4.0,Surprised the bone in ribeye was tough at medium rare.

06/23/2019,PamelaR,5.0,We go to Michael Jordan’s for birthdays and our anniversary.  The food is always excellent.
06/22/2019,AshlieF,5.0,I had an amazing night! They made my anniversary special and made me feel like I was important! Will go back every time I go to Mohegan!!
06/22/2019,redrose5200,5.0,"First time dining here and I thought the food was excellent.  Steak was cooked perfectly and I must admit, I think it was the best steak I ever ate.  Baked Alaska was delicious too but definitely can be shared, too much for one person."
06/22/2019,WilliamG,5.0,Service was wonderful. The meal was delicious. We have eaten here before n will again when we come again to Mohegan Sun.
06/22/2019,KristinPezz,5.0,Wonderful as always! We have been dining here for years. Always consistent great cuisine. Wonderful Servers! Especially Nancy B

06/16/2019,black1,4.0,While service and food were very good. The menus is a little limited compared to the bar side. Music choice was not as relaxing as should have been and sound level was too high for a fine dining situation.
06/16/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Father’s Day Ryan was our server and he was great!!
06/16/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"One of the best restaurants in CT, love this place!"

06/14/2019,Sami,5.0,We were sat in the back and it was perfect. We were on a romantic date and it was nice that we weren't in the middle of the restaurant where it was loud and noisy. Our waiter Jimmy was amazing and so helpful with us picking out our dinners.

06/08/2019,EdwardJ,4.0,"Overall, we had a good experience. My filet was good, but came out to our table only warm. One son had an excellent steak, while the other’s was not good at all (they compensated us with s free appetizer which doesn’t really make up for it). My wife liked her filet. 

Service was very good. Restaurant is worth a shot if you are in the casino and want steak."
06/08/2019,VanessaM,5.0,Best experience overall. Food was amazing. Service was pleasent and prompt. Deffinitly coming here again
06/08/2019,terig,5.0,"My husband and I had a most enjoyable dining experience at Michael Jordan's Steak House this past Saturday to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The food was delicious!! We started with a shared caesar salad with anchovies and the colossal crab cake (fantastic). Both our New York strip steak and the petite filet mignon were perfect-tender, flavorful and cooked as requested. Our tasty sides, the classic mashed potatoes and the roasted mushrooms completed our dinner with room for little else because the portions were more than ample even for a good appetite.

Rounding out this wonderful evening was the fine staff at Michael Jordan's.  Compliments to the host/hostesses who greeted  and seated us to our waiter Ryan and assistant Ryan, who were attentive, efficient and appropriately friendly.  We look forward to returning and highly recommend this Michael Jordan's Steak House to others."

06/07/2019,KenS,5.0,We always have a wonderful dinner at this restaurant. It is a great complement to The Mohegan Sun facility.
06/07/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"All of the waitstaff were amazing. My friend had to bring her son (babysitter issues) and the staff were so amazing with him. I think every waiter/waitress said hi to him. Our waitress was great!! So friendly, fast and efficient. Great time!"
06/02/2019,BernardG,5.0,Great   Service was wonderful and good delicious
06/02/2019,EllenZ,5.0,What a treat from an awesome Dirty Martini to the assortment of mashed potatoes.... the Petit Filet it was just lovely. We were seated right away with our reservation and service was quick but not rushed. Look forward to going back!
06/01/2019,SeanO,4.0,"Super loud group of obnoxious drunks next to us really put a damper on what should have been an awesome experience.  First two visits were great, this one missed the mark.  Isolated event im sure."
06/01/2019,MichaelK,5.0,Brian was great and accommodating. Food and drink was as great as expected.

I was just expecting something better the way my friend was raving about it. I had way better steak at David Burke at Foxwoods."
05/31/2019,CC01,5.0,"Only reason it was noisy is because there was a bachelor party going on but besides that, the noise level was fine"
05/31/2019,InnessaL,5.0,Great meal with a steak perfectly cooked and awesome flavor. Definitely will go back.
05/30/2019,Christali,5.0,"We were on our vacation & had been before to Mohegan Sun Casino but didn’t get to eat at this restaurant. I made sure we did this time. Every thing was wonderful except the music. I would have preferred light jazz, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, easy listening music."
05/29/2019,FrankA,5.0,Amazing service and food for my girlfriend and I. Highly recommend MJs to all my friends every time we speak of great steak!
05/27/2019,kfromboston,5.0,We had a really enjoyable dinner at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse. The food was excellent and the service was outstanding. A bit pricey but a great spot for a special occasion dinner.
05/27/2019,Partyof5,4.0,Good food and great service. The restaurant is a little dark for food consumption. Otherwise no complaints.
05/27/2019,KatrynaM,4.0,"Service was slow initially, took about 5 minutes before we were greeted at our table. The dumplings came out very quickly however they were not prepared well at all. The outside was warm and the inside was very chilled, are they supposed to be prepared to come out warm or cold? The Delmonico was prepared ok, a little heavy on the char where parts of the steak were borderline coal, but temp was correct. The sides were seasoned a little too heavily for our liking. The price point was pretty standard for this fare however I don’t think the food was worthy of it ."
05/27/2019,karinm,5.0,Awesome ... love to sit at the bar because the bartenders are the best!
05/27/2019,CRW33,5.0,"Surf & turf was unreal, drinks were great & the staff is very friendly!"

05/18/2019,Lambchopporky,5.0,"I love the restaurant . The food is outstanding. The food melts in your mouth. The restaurant has many choices to choose from. It’s a nice place to have a nice romantic meal or to sit down with friends to chat and have a great meal. Each time I go to Mohegan sun ,  I go to Michael Jordan’s to have a great meal. Mohegan sun and Michael’s Jordan’s are the perfect match. You have to try them both. Just love it!

05/12/2019,RonB,5.0,We always have service and the food is awesome! I recommend anyone that is looking for a great steakhouse
05/12/2019,KathyP,5.0,I have eaten there many times and  was never disappointed.  However at hotel checkout we were charged someone else's bill in addition to ours.  The hotel is trying to straighten it out but so far I haven't  heard anything.
05/12/2019,GoodFoodGal,5.0,Phenomenal service and food!!
05/12/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"From the min we arrived we were treated with utmost hospitality 
We were seated right away 
Waited on immediately 
And offered a appetizer 
The specials and menu was explained in detail 
I requested a few changes and was extremely happy with the accommodations they made for me 
My meal was prepared perfectly and was delicious 
My husband ordered the ribeye and he said it was done perfectly as well
It is a little pricey or we’d be visiting 
MJ restaurant more often 
Highly recommended!"
05/12/2019,CarolW,5.0,"The waiter was very attentive and returned to our table to check on us often.  The food was excellent.  My husband and  I ordered our filet steaks medium rare. In the future I would order it rare as I would like it a little less done.  However, the steak was excellent and they did not overdo the sauce on top.  I had the creamed spinach which was different than any I had in the past.  The mashed potato trio was excellent as well.  Our daughter had the tuna which she enjoyed very much. She ended her dinner with the baked Alaska, which was to die for.  I also liked the fact that you can see the chefs, so you know what’s going on in the kitchen.  It is a little pricey, but for a special occasion I would go back again."
05/11/2019,PatrickF,4.0,"Everything was great! Me and my wife were there for our anniversary dinner and couldn't have asked for a better night!  The service was great, everybody was very friendly and helpful with any questions.  The steak was one of the best my wife has had and they even brought a complimentary champagne drink for the two of us to celebrate with.  would def. go back and recommend to anyone looking for a great dining experience!"
05/11/2019,Gina0505,4.0,Food was great. Just a bit expensive $120 for two steaks and a corn to share
05/11/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Jimmie was great. Very good service. Manager stopped by to check which was very nice.
Serving of port was small should be increased"
05/11/2019,JuanH,5.0,It was an amazing dinner. The food was out of this world and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. Only negative was the waiter took a long time to grab our order but everything else was smooth sailing!
05/10/2019,HenryB,5.0,Service was awesome!!! Great food. Come here to eat everytime we are in town.
05/10/2019,Eric,4.0,It's was completely delicious from beginning to end and everything you would expect from a great steakhouse with awesome service by Rob.

05/05/2019,TamaraG,5.0,"The waitress was amazing. Very informative, kind , and welcoming. Would definately recommend to any one looking for a great steak!"
05/05/2019,FranklinO,3.0,Ran out of ribeye steak - first choice. Lamb chops were so-so.
05/05/2019,TakRon,5.0,We celebrated my husbands birthday on a busy Saturday night. We made a reservation.  They sat us within 1 min of arrival. Our server Jimmy was amazing from start to finish. He made great suggestions and knew the menu well.  The food was awesome. My fillet was cooked to perfection.  The garlic bread was one of a kind. Yum! You have to try it. Will definitely visit again.
05/05/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Our waiter, Chris, was excellent and very nice. He worked with my gf on the DL to surprise me with a birthday dessert. I was surprised. We also had to post our reservations twice from 7p to 8:30 then 9:15p. I greatly appreciate the hostesses assisting us with that immensely."
05/04/2019,VerySatisfied,5.0,"For the umpteenth straight year, my buddies and I celebrated after the Kentucky Derby at Michael Jordan's at Mohegan Sun.  As always, the selection was vast, the food and service were great and management assisted us in celebrating a milestone birthday for two of us with a delicious piece of pastry (and candle).  Michael Jordan's always exceeds our expectations."
05/04/2019,JoeU,5.0,Great food. Excellent service delivery of food was timely
05/04/2019,JohnM,5.0,"The waiter was attentive without being overbearing, suggestive without being pushy. From the appetizers to the main course to dessert everything was excellent with little wait time"
05/04/2019,Jazmin,5.0,"It was our first time here and I have to say everything was amazing. The servers were attentive and educated on the menu. 
The food was to die for. We had the 10oz filet mignon and the rib eye- both melted in your mouth. The mashed potatoes trio was the most delicious mashed potatoes I’ve ever had."
05/04/2019,Greatexperience2018,3.0,"Steak was just ok.   And  prices for the little things is getti g out of control.   $10 for Garlic Bread or a Baked Potato  ?  

Always thought this was the only real good choice at Mohegan. Will have to explore other places in the future.   

Also was a bit upset i was nt allowed into the Arena with our doggie bag.  My wife only ate half of her bone in Rib Eye.    Our waiter clearly knew we where going to the Concert.     In the future it would be helpful if the wait staff advised patrons that food needs to be brought to ypur room or ypur car and not allowed in the arena."
05/04/2019,lefty,5.0,"Excellent meal. Anniversary dinner. Service was top notch. Our waiter Chris was attentive, informative and allowed us to enjoy our meal without feeling rushed.  Delmonico Steak perfectly cooked. Lobster very flavorful. Nice wine selection as well."
05/04/2019,Sarah,5.0,"The service was unbelievable. We were never left sitting with a dirty or finished plate or an empty drink. The staff were beyond friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. They made great recommendations too! The food from beginning to end was outstanding. The appetizers were perfectly sized for two people and the waitress even informed us we could split two choices in half so we didn’t have to order three full appetizers to try different things. The entrees came out cooked perfectly and there wasn’t anything left on the plate when all was said and done. With our dessert, she brought us two glasses of champagne to toast our recent engagement (which she remembered from light conversation at the beginning of the meal). Five stars isn’t enough. Everything was wonderful"
05/04/2019,Paul117,5.0,Great food and selection  !!!! Server I believe his name was Adam was fantastic  !!!
05/03/2019,DebbieP,5.0,Amazing service and food.
05/02/2019,michaeld,5.0,"Dinner was exceptional, everything was   just the way you would like it. Jimmy our waiter was  great, his knowledge of the menu was outstanding he made our dinning experience unforgettable. This is one restaurant I will return to when I visit Mohegan Sun. Overall a wonderful dining experience."
04/29/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Everything was Great! The food , service all top shelf. Please bring back the multi- grain rolls. Look forward to seeing you again soon."
04/28/2019,JulieC,5.0,Went for my boyfriends birthday everything was perfect. The food was the best and the service was amazing. Would definitely go back
04/28/2019,JenniferM,3.0,"the food, ambiance and waiter were wonderful as always"
04/27/2019,StephanieW,2.0,"Terrible service.  Reservations at 7:30, seated at close to 8.  Front desk was rude and acted like they were a part of Mean Girls.  When I told the waiter, Brian, there was a chip in my glass, and handed it to him, I wasn’t sure if he heard me, I repeated it, to which he replied, I heard you the first time.  Lovely!  
Food was delicious and sommelier was wonderful.  No manager came by to see how it was going.  At this price, really expected a bit better.  Have eaten there in the past and been pleased, but would not go again.  Management needs to step up with regards to the front desk and wait staff."
04/27/2019,RobJ,5.0,Great food and service. I told them it way my girlfriends birthday. They gave us champagne and put a candle in our 23 layer cake. What a great experience. We’ll definitely be back
04/27/2019,BayyinahJ,5.0,I had a wonderful birthday evening. Food is absolutely delicious. I must say the steak was the best I ever had. Service was good and they were professional. The only issue i had was the lighting it is a strain for those who are visually challenged.  Other than that we enjoyed our experience and will eat here again.
04/27/2019,KenS,5.0,"Whenever we go to Mohegan Sun, one of the best parts of our trip is dinner at Michael Jordan's Steak House."
04/27/2019,RobertW,4.0,Steak was very fatty but overall a very nice place
04/25/2019,Squeezer,4.0,Delicious meal from start to finish.
04/25/2019,TheresaM,5.0,"You don’t have to be a basketball or sports fanatic to thoroughly enjoy Michael Jordan’s steak house! The menu offers a nice variety for all. The Maine Oysters from the raw bar were bar none. If you enjoy lamb chops, the double cut ones on the menu are a must! The Delmonico steak was tender and juicy with a side of roasted asparagus, seasoned just right! Our server Jules was friendly, cordial and attentive. The key lime pie gave us flash backs to one we had in the Florida keys, which was on point. Oh and even if you skip the signature garlic bread and opt for the basket of dinner rolls, you’ll be a happy diner! Enjoy~"
04/25/2019,Eddie,5.0,Unbelievable service and food. We always return here on our visits to Ct.
04/24/2019,LukeA,4.0,Very good restaurant. Highlights were crab cake appetizer and steaks (Bone in Ribeye) Sides were very good and service excellent. I was skeptical going in but very impressed leaving. Good experience.
04/24/2019,DavidB,5.0,"Excellent steak , wonderful friendly staff I highly recommend"
04/23/2019,FoodLover,5.0,"The bone in Delmonico two of us had was cooked perfectly to our request (red, warm and juicy), one of us had a Prime Delmonico cooked to his request also.  The sauteed mushrooms was a great mix and cooked and seasoned very well.  The French fries were cooked absolutely perfect - crisp and hot.  The provided me with marrow butter for the steak which was wonderful.  We had the Garlic bread for starter and was perfect especially with the Gorgonzola fondue.  Dessert was the Key Lime pie and a multi layer chocolate cake both wonderful.  Service was beyond perfect - helpful (my requested half pour of wine no problem), efficient, pleasant and not at all intrusive but attentive.  Very well done.  Prices high but worth every single penny spent."
04/22/2019,Kimmmmmmm,4.0,"We love Michael Jordan's.  Food, wine and service always GREAT!"
04/21/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We celebrated our Easter at Michael Jordan’s Steakhouse. We couldn’t have picked a better place!  The food and drinks were superb, as was the service!"
04/21/2019,SusanO,5.0,Wonderful!! Impeccable service from very friendly staff. Attentive to our needs without being intrusive. Management was around to ensure we were satisfied. Can’t wait for a return trip.
04/20/2019,Annie,5.0,Beautiful interior.  Service prompt and friendly.  Food was excellent - steak cooked to perfection and creamed spinach was best I’ve ever had!
04/20/2019,Caroln,4.0,"Big fan of steak houses and find the chains sometimes have flat flavorless steaks regardless of what I order. First time to Michael Jordan’s. Very nice, you are treated very well by the staff. It was just my daughter and myself and we were dressed more like casino slots players than fine dining patrons but still treated like we were special.  Hands dow best, most delicious, flavorful, tender boneless sirloin I have ever had.  The only complaint was the jumbo shrimp cocktail (4 for $20) were a little tough.  Surprised at that price. Someone left them in the water a minute too long. Wasn’t worth complaining. Everything else (lobster dumplings, Lobster tails, my steak, etc) was perfect"
04/19/2019,AnneA,5.0,"Food was excellent, waitress gave just the right amount of attention.  Would visit again"
04/18/2019,KimberlyA,5.0,"Best steak dinner we’ve ever had! From the bread all the way to the dessert, the entire dinner was worth every cent!"
04/15/2019,MartinS,3.0,Very expensive and you don't get much bang for the buck. I visit many steakhouses and this was my first time at MJ's. Ordered the porterhouse for two and it was the size of a porterhouse for one. Steak tasted like a good diner steak
04/14/2019,AlfredP,5.0,"We've been in the sports bar and last night the steak house, it was exceptional. Server Jimmy seemed to have a crew of assistants, they all were great always checking to see if we needed anything. Our first time in the steak house and we will go back. 5 stars."
04/14/2019,Eric,3.0,"Atmosphere was very loud. Steaks were over priced for the quality. Steaks seemed to be reheated instead of being cooked from scratch. If I am paying $60 for a steak, I expected it to be cooked upon order and not reheated. I have had steaks from all over the world and from hole in the wall joints to high end restaurants so I know what a good steak should entail. Service was good."
04/13/2019,ReginaA,4.0,"This is a yearly visit for us from TX as family lives in CT. This year we coordinated it with my birthday. April 13th was a JT concert at Mohegan Sun so we knew it would be packed. Our table was prepped and we were seated about 10-15 min later. Our server was Jimmy (he was amazing and had perfect timing with giving us an excellent experience). The one shadow over this celebratory night was the table next to us. They acted as though they were at a bar/pub; so extremely loud that our server had to squat down for us to hear him. He went to advise the manager; making no assurances that the group would quiet down.

The manager came by and observed the table and conduct and then came over to our table. Without ever advising them that their noise level was disruptive to other patrons the answer was to move us. We had a perfect round table that yielded a fantastic view for those who were first time patrons in our group. I definitely voiced this to he manager and we begrudgingly moved to another table. It took a while for this sour note to subside but Jimmy was great and turned the experience around.

Note to patrons of this restaurant and any other...be respectful and mindful of your impact on others. One day you will want to have a civilized experience wherever you are and if people are allowed to be loud, belligerent morons, you would be aggravated also."
04/13/2019,GaryT,5.0,"Was one of the best filet mignon that I have had, albeit, it was a little on the salty side.  Overall, the dinner was excellent and delicious."
04/13/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Petite filet was delicious and perfectly cooked! Try the corn as well as the garlic bread with blue cheese fondue—amazing!
04/13/2019,JoshK,2.0,"The waitress was very slow and not attentive, had to ask other servers for another drink and even cracked pepper for salad. Spoke to manager and he said he would keep an eye and check on us, however, he never showed the rest of the meal..."
04/12/2019,AMKT,5.0,Wait Staff was fabulous. Food delicious. Enjoyed our dinner & will be back soon!
04/12/2019,MelissaK,5.0,"Ambience is nice, a little loud. Make reservations, bar gets over crowded. Lots of specials."

04/11/2019,Sciflyer,4.0,"Everything was great except the NY strip.  The meat was very tough.  To the point I almost considered sending it back.  The bacon, bisque and potatoes were fantastic and our waiter Brian was on point the entire dinner."
04/08/2019,Luke,5.0,Awesome as usual!!!
04/08/2019,NancyP,5.0,"Excellent dinner, wonderful selection on menu. Everything is always delicious! 
Love eating at Michael Jordan's Steak House when visiting Mohegan Sun!"
04/07/2019,MickieB,5.0,we were there celebrating my husband birthday.  We were greeted seated immediately and my husband was handed a birthday card.  I thought that was exceptional.  Our server Melissa came over right away.  Took our order and she made some great recommendations.  Food came fast hot and tasty.  over all outstanding dinning experience.  We will return in the summer.
04/07/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"It was our eleventh year anniversary and I wanted to take Daniela to a top end place. Jordan’s lived up to its reputation, from the table atmosphere to the service all the way down to the food and presentation. Loved it and recommend it to anyone. Thank you Jordan’s well be back."
04/06/2019,JodiR,5.0,Outrageous food and service! Can’t wait to go back again
04/06/2019,PeterZ,2.0,I ordered the Porterhouse for two and thought is was a poor cut of meat and very fatty. For $92 I expected much more and doubt I will return to Michael Jordan's again. I visit Mohegan Sun often and feel there are much better options
04/05/2019,joannec,4.0,Food is pricey.  I have eaten there many times.  The noise level was just outrageous and the restaurant was NOT full.  Not a place where you can carry on a conversation  without yelling.
04/05/2019,ValerieS,5.0,Great service and atmosphere
04/05/2019,Foodie4Life,5.0,All i can say is crab cakes.  I can't get enough of them.  They are the best crab cakes I have ever had at any steakhouse in CT or NY.
04/05/2019,Shushayla,1.0,"I’m sorry for writing this terrible review, but years ago, Michael Jordan’s was excellent. Now it is nothing but disappointing. Initials were carved in our table, the room smelled like a wet mop, $18 bottles of wine were $65.00, waiter didn’t know of the Friday Lenten special. We had a reservation and were told to “stand to the right and wait to be seated”  We should have been seated, as we arrived right on time. 
I think Michael Jordan would be ashamed. 
If we hear that that they’ve been overhauled, we would certainly try it again. 
AND, we are not “high rollers” so we were paying full price for our meals. 
WE LEFT and had a great meal down the hall. So sad."
04/03/2019,KimberlyM,5.0,"Waitress was great, staff was great.  Manager Tom came over to our table.
Food came out quick and was amazing. 
Portions are great. Our table setting and location was great.
Overall, perfect experience."
04/02/2019,PriamoG,2.0,They didn’t have the ribeye instead I order the filet mignon and it was not what I expected or wanted and I order the mash and it was room temperature warm it was not hot at all my wife order the New York strip and it taste blend not happy at all when there thinking it was going to be great and it was very disappointed not to eat what u wanted and to her cold mash.
04/01/2019,SybilH1995,5.0,"My boyfriend and I went for a date night. Waitress was very friendly, attentive, knowledgeable about menu and recommendations. Whatever mood you're in the atmosphere (lighting/ decor) just clicks with it haha. I'm a huge steak lover and was quite satisfied with the Porterhouse for two. But oh my Gosh! The Roasted Heirloom Carrots, were to die for!"
03/31/2019,TaraV,5.0,"My favorite place to eat.  Service is always great and the food is amazing. Best filet and I have to get lobster mashed.  I would like to try other item, but my usual are just so good.  It used to be a once or twice a year treat, but if you are at the casino, you are blowing money anyway. You might as well have a delicious meal. I know it is all loaded with butter, but that is what makes it taste so good."
03/31/2019,JenniferA,5.0,"We have been here numerous times and its our favorite restaurant.  We had to change our reservation time a couple times the latest being at 530 to a 630 reservation and i received confirmation.  Upon arriving at 620 mind you 10 minutes EARLY the girl at the front desk very RUDELY said ""Aslan? -you are over 15 minutes late for your reservation but luckily for you we can still seat you"" in a VERY rude and snotty voice.  I very nicely said my reservation is at 630 and i am actually 10 min early.  I then proceeded to show her my conformation email. She THEN said ""oh i believed you but it wasnt in our system"" i dont care if there is a system glitch you do NOT treat your guests and customers with this tone of voice or assume things BEFORE knowing the circumstances and then NO Apology???.  I wouldve walked out had we not been celebrating our anniversary and looking forward to dinner.  Please train your greeters in customer service and friendliness. Thank you.  As a repeat customer I do not want to look forward to this happening again."
03/31/2019,JamesK,5.0,"Amazing experience as usual. You get what you pay for, quality food and attentive service."
03/31/2019,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Requested a red velvet booth and didn’t get it. Ordered the Wagyu strip and didn’t feel that it was any different from a regular strip. Our server Brian was fantastic. He provided an excellent service. Everything else wasn’t up to par. Also not sure why there was a mushroom sauce on a wagyu strip.
03/30/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Anniversary
03/30/2019,UnbelievableMeal,5.0,Food was amazing.  Staff couldn't do enough to make us happy.  I have been there several times and it is always an excellent experience all around.
03/30/2019,GaryV,2.0,"Bad experience all around, food was somewhat cold and tasteless, I brought a date with me and it was not a very good first impression, i would have expected better food based on reviews, none of which happened.
thank you.
Mr Vicars."
03/29/2019,MarissaT,5.0,"Chris K. Made sure we had an amazing dining experience! He was very knowledgeable of the menu! I called ahead and requested the cozy booth (highly recommend) and they were able to seat us there. My husband’s steak was cooked perfectly. I highly recommend the garlic bread (you’ll be tempted to lick the plate), the Mac and cheese is delicious and the creamed spinach is a favorite. To end the night, Chris brought over a piece of chocolate cake for my husband’s birthday. Request him on your next visit and you won’t be disappointed! 

The booth helps to seclude you from the noise. The restaurant is not very noisy but people are there to enjoy their night so don’t expect silence."
03/29/2019,DianeO,5.0,"Everything was great including the service by our waiter, Chris K. Our cocktails were delightful and the food cooked to perfection. It was the place to be on our special day."
03/29/2019,NikkiP,5.0,"Absolutely unbelievable service and food! I took my husband here for his birthday and couldn’t have chosen a better place! Besides his love for Michael Jordan, the atmosphere, our server and our food were out of this world! He said it was the best steak he’s ever had in his life, and we can’t wait to go back!"

03/23/2019,PhilB,5.0,It was my birthday and my sisters. We were charged for dessert. I thought that was a little greedy on your behalf
03/23/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Michael Jordan’s Steak House is our go to when visiting Mohegan Sun. An outstanding meal was the highlight of our trip this time. Thank you to our server, Chris K for the great service."
03/23/2019,JudyP,5.0,Absolutely amazing in all areas. Can’t wait to go again!!
03/23/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Everything was excellent! From the crab cake appetizer to the Delmonico and filets and all the sides. To my wife and another couple there for our anniversary and have no regrets top notch service and food!

03/21/2019,MichaelV,4.0,"The food was best you can get at casino .. 
service was good . Priced as expected .. 
If I had more time I would have driven to Foxwoods for dinner and back to  Mohegan sun for the concert .."
03/21/2019,Matt,5.0,"Food was excellent. I got the Delmonico steak, it was one of the best steaks I’ve had. Staff was very friendly, knowledgeable and service was good. We were in a rush to see a show at the arena so the check could’ve come a little quicker at the end but the food was served quickly and it wasn’t really an issue. The price was high but about what you would expect for the level of food and service you receive. Would definitely eat here again"
03/21/2019,ColletteB,3.0,The table was worn and peeling. The steak was charred and raw on the inside. The lobster tail was dry.  The wine was good. The mashed potatoes were overkill.  It’s a 2 or 3 star restaurant that thinks it’s 4 star.   Would not go back.
03/21/2019,JasonM,5.0,"Our waitress was amazing.  Wish we could remember her name. She was very friendly and helpful even though we had many questions and specific wishes to how our food was prepared.  Just in case this review makes it back to the management at Michael Jordan‘s, I will say that she was tall, slender with glasses and very outgoing and friendly.  She rides a triumph motorcycle apparently :-)  Give that girl a raise!"
03/21/2019,Luval22,5.0,Always great food!
03/20/2019,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Food was sub par. Service and management was amazing. Steak had no flavor or salt.
03/19/2019,JoeG,5.0,"My wife and I went to Michael Jordan’s for an anniversary dinner, and enjoyed it very much. Our waiter Steve was wonderful, my wife’s steak was prepared perfectly and tasted great, and I tried some items off their new vegan menu, dumplings and a pasta dish, both were very good. A little expensive, but a very good special occasion spot. We’ll return."
03/18/2019,Coorsb,5.0,"Excellent dinner! Service, food wonderful. Made us feel very welcomed!"
03/18/2019,SandraP,4.0,"Food is always excellent.  Service was very good as well.  The only reason we rate this 4 instead of 5 stars is because they have taken some items off the menu over the last few years and when we ask about them, each time we go there, we are told that everyone keeps asking about them, but the restaurant has not placed them back on the menu.  That tells me that the corporation does not take the feedback seriously.  However, based on the food quality and service, we would rate them a 5."
03/17/2019,olandop,5.0,"Kernel, 
Went there for my birthday, my wife and i really enjoyed the food, and the service was very good."

03/17/2019,CourtneyJ,3.0,Food was good but menu a bit pricey! Decor a bit dated but overall I would give it 3.5 stars.
03/17/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Came in for my girlfriends birthday. Chris K was wonderful and helpful throughout the whole meal. Would absolutely come back and recommend to friends.
03/16/2019,CindyD,5.0,Been there several times always excellent Service & Food.
03/16/2019,Rmom,4.0,"Dined here with my husband this past Saturday. We enjoyed our filets very much, definitely recommend adding the truffled Parmesan crust to your steak. It is worth the upcharge. The Mac and cheese side was delicious - thanks to our waiter Danielle for the recommendation. The 23 layer cake however was dry and lacking in flavor, shocking from previous visits when it was moist and delicious. Overall a great dinner, although a bit pricey - but I guess that happens being in a casino."
03/16/2019,AnthonyD,3.0,"The food was good, but not worth the money. Very loud and seating was too close to the next party or couple. For their prices, sides should be included and dessert. It was fine for a one time experience but don't intend to come back."
03/16/2019,ChristenaS,5.0,"Highly recommend! We will definitely be back! Our server Nancy was well educated in the menu. She provided us with a wine which was delicious. 
Apps
-Lobster  Bisque-A But eatery but good
-Crab Cake-DELICIOUS Must try!

Main
-Brisket-Sooo good. Delicious
-Bone In- Husband said it was juicy and tasty
-Roasted Corn-Crunchy  and tasty 

We wanted to try the garlic bread with the mystery blue cheese sauce but didn’t want the whole serving. Nancy said they could do a half portion. It was WELL WORTH THE ORDER! Must try!!!

And for dessert we had the BAKED ALASKA!
OOOOHHHH MYHHYH GOODNESS!

This place was hands down worth the drive from NY

Our bill with til was about $220
It wasn’t bad considering all we had! And no complaints! Everything was delicious. And service was great."

03/15/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great choices on the menu. So many things that I liked I had a hard time picking one out. We were a party of four and everyone thought their meals were outstanding. Service was impeccable thank you to our server Nancy. Highly recommend. Looking forward to going back.

03/10/2019,MJBerry,5.0,Hands down the best restaurant at Mohegan Sun!  Love the Caesar salad and bone-in filet mignon is best steak.  My husband always gets the Delmonico which is his favorite.  The mushrooms and mashed potato trio rounds out the steaks nicely.  Paired with a wonderful Pinot Noir and you have a wonderful dinner.  Service is impeccable.  Will get you well satisfied and ready to win big in the casino!
03/10/2019,RSJ23,5.0,"The food was outstanding. My wife and I have the petite filets which were cooked perfectly. The staff was very attentive to my wife's food allergies.

03/10/2019,ChadA413,5.0,We went to Mohegan Sun for our Anniversary weekend. The dinner at Michael Jordan’s was amazing! We ordered based on our server’s recommendations and she got it right!! Everything was delicious! The blue cheese fondue was so different-a must get appetizer! All the staff made our experience special-the tucked away booth was very cozy! Thanks for a memorable time!
03/10/2019,DinaP,4.0,"I Was not as satisfied as i hoped to be at this place. I really thought it would have been a bit more of an upscale dining scene. The crab cake appetizer was probably the best part of our visit. Service was fine. Main courses though, were sub par. The filet mignon that i ordered medium was completely well done. Not a hint of pink anywhere. The mashed potato and French fries sides were fine. The drinks we ordered were nothing special. The infamous 23 layer cake was not what it seemed. But most of all, seeing guests with ripped jeans, baggy sweatshirts (with stains on them) , and baseball caps... is not my idea of fine dining ! Unfortunately i would not go back :/"
03/09/2019,MichaelP,4.0,Always very good here. Should think about getting gluten free items

03/02/2019,DENISED,5.0,"Amazing fooding experience!  Yes it's pricy but the food and service are exceptional.  We used the services of Jules the Sommelier who recommended the perfect bottle of wine within the range we requested.  Our waitress Sara was attentive, friendly and helped us choose the Garlic Bread as an appetizer which was sooooo good!
Not necessarily a spot for every weekend given the price, but highly recommend for special occasions.   Let them know ahead of time we were celebrating my husband's birthday.  They gave him a birthday card from MJ and a candle in his dessert.  Very nice and jut the right amount of extra attention !"
03/02/2019,Aidita1728,5.0,Is a very nice restaurant great food good atmosphere staff is really helpful prices a little bit high but good food🙂
03/02/2019,KG12345,5.0,"We LOVED this place!  The ambience was nice, and since it's at a casino, it isn't too fancy-schmancy, but it delivers with their food.  If you like bleu cheese, you HAVE to get the garlic bread appetizer...quite amazing bleu cheese sauce.  And the bone marrow butter! SO GOOD!  We ordered the Porterhouse for 2,  and it didn't disappoint.  If only we had more people with us, we would have tried a meat flight...…!!

Our server was courteous and helpful and shared stories with us.  We had a great night!"
03/02/2019,pemberley2,5.0,Love the flight options. What a fantastic way to sample the phenomenal variety of cuts!
03/02/2019,jennifera,5.0,One of our favorites. Always a  delicious meal and great service.
03/02/2019,GinaF,3.0,This steakhouse is way to pricey for the quality and taste of their food.  Does not come close to Morton’s or Peter Lugers.
03/02/2019,JimB,5.0,Great service and meal as it always is at this restaurant. Love coming back to this location. Look forward to the next visit.

02/27/2019,JohnH,4.0,My $49 filet was ordered medium well but i explained i didn’t want it over cooked so the server offered to have it cooked medium/medium  she explained was not too well and not too rare!! IT WAS BURNT!! I was disgusted!! Total bill for 2 was just under $270.00
02/26/2019,Jordan,3.0,"One steak cooked perfectly, second was requested as medium, came more well done with very little pink left and almost dry. Great flavor though. Meatball appetizer was ok, nothing super special. Add-ons (shrimp for 1 steak and scallops for other) had very good flavor but only got two of each. Not sure $8 is worth 1 shrimp or scallop. Ambiance was good as expected. Service was average, more like service you’d expect at Applebee’s. Waiter forgot one of our drinks, needed to be reminded about 10 minutes after One of our drinks arrived, which would be understandable if it were busy, but it wasn’t. At least he was occupying his time with a cute waitress. Points given for that effort. For the price it could have been better. All in all not a bad experience but we were expecting to be a little more satisfied based on reviews from friends who’d been there before us. Almost $300 for 1 app (4 meatballs), 2 steaks (7 oz each), 2 shrimp, 2 scallops,  1 side each (French fries and creamed spinach) and 1 drink each. No dessert, dessert menu wasn’t anything to splurge on. Tasted great but will check out Burke Prime before going back here."
02/24/2019,Gabby,5.0,Love love this place
02/24/2019,OpenTable Diner,4.0,The staff was very accommodating.  The meal prices were way over valued.
02/24/2019,Jennifer,5.0,"Colossal Crabcake was delicious. Chicken was good but nothing special. They have a mashed potato sampler with 3 different types which was really good. Then lastly the Baked Alaska was amazing!! 

Service was great. Our waitress was super accommodating."
02/24/2019,Travis,5.0,Everything was excellent. The Sommelier was a tremendous help and we took her recommendation for wines to pair with our meals. Service was great and we had a blast for my birthday. Thank you!
02/24/2019,KristinP,5.0,If you want the best fillet and sides and choice of wine last Michael Jordan’s is the place to go I love coming here any chance I can get put to celebrate special occasions makes this even better. The quality of food service is spectacular enjoy
02/23/2019,MP0WER,5.0,"We have been going here intermittently for years... maybe once or twice a year for about the past 10-12 years.

They win with consistency.  Over this same period of time, I can expect an amazing meal.  I always get the crab cake and the 10oz Filet.  Each time I have gone, they have been perfect... across over a decade!

Now it's not the best Filet I've ever had, but it's definitely top 5, maybe even top 3.  I will say it's the best $50 Filet I've ever had.

Seems silly that I travel from Foxwoods (where I was staying overnight and where my show was) to come here simply for dinner... but it's totally worth it."
02/23/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"As consistent as always, very good experience."
02/23/2019,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Excellent steak and seafood tower. Slow service

02/22/2019,KathrynM,5.0,This is one of my favorite restaurants. Food is always exceptional!
02/21/2019,BeckiMK,3.0,"Our appetizers were great (shrimp cocktail and oysters), however our filets were terrible. My husband ordered his medium, I ordered mine medium well. His came out VERY rare, when he said something he was told it was a ‘perfect medium’, it was blood red in the center, and barely any better around the edges. Mine came out well done. No pink anywhere to be seen. 

They were also the most over seasoned, salty filets I’ve ever tasted. 

They did do the right thing and take one steak off the bill. We went on to have a great night at Mohegan, but we were VERY disappointed in our $150 meal. (It would have been $200+ had they not removed one of our steaks from the bill)."
02/21/2019,AnnetteF,5.0,"Food was DELICIOUS! Our waiter Brian was full of knowledge when it came to explaining the types of steaks, the additions to the steaks, etc... I would DEFINITELY go back! It’s just a long drive for me!! But WELL worth it!!"
02/21/2019,KatieI,5.0,"Went here to celebrate a delayed Valentines Day dinner, and I would return here time and time again. For the price you’re paying, you will receive the most delicious meal of your life. The ambience is dark, and gives you the feeling of a private dinner. Because you are in a casino, there is a lot of foot traffic and noise, but they somehow managed to drown out any noise. 

If you are going to put your money anywhere in the casino, please stop here. My boyfriend who is nowhere near a “foodie” has brought up the steak we’ve had every day since we’ve been there. Unforgettable!"
02/20/2019,Cesca919,5.0,"Probbaly the best steak I’ve ever had. The truffle Parmesan add on is fantastic! Great service, great ambience, and great food!!"

02/18/2019,Steeltowngirl,5.0,"Appetizers was the Filet Mignon sliders are the bomb....very good, tender, filling.....
Crab Cake.....is to die for....large lump crab, with just a little crunch on top ...beautiful and tasty 
Filet mignon entrée  was so tender it melted in your mouth,  Mash potato trio was another awesome dish enough for two people, and Boneless New York strip steak was another in the mouth melting ...bottled water was delicious … We had no room for dessert but I'm sure if we had something, there would be raved reviews"
02/18/2019,AngL,3.0,"Step up the quality of the rolls/bread served at the beginning of the meal. The rolls were nothing special at all...something I could get at my local grocery store. We expected something much fancier for such a high end restaurant. Also, for the price of the meal and the high end ambiance of finer dining, the steakhouse should not have to share restroom facilities with the sports bar next door. That was surprising and disappointing. Service was good and the food was as expected."
02/18/2019,Mike,4.0,"Great food! Unfortunately the restaurant had run out of the larger filet choice and only had the smaller so for the difference in price it felt more expensive than it should have been. Like other steakhouses everything is separate so the bill runs up quickly, but the food is certainly good. Would most likely come back."

Our Appetizer was great and my 16oz New york strip was cooked perfectly to my liking and the sides are a perfect portion for sharing.... the Mj 23 layer cake was perfect to top off the night!! Its a must stop for steak while at Mohegan sun

02/14/2019,Awesome,5.0,Excellent food. Superb service. Wait time for food was ideal. All around perfect dinner date. Price is not cheap - but worth every penny.

02/09/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great food. We keep going back. Love it.
02/09/2019,PennyRedstar,5.0,"The food was exceptional. Prices are on the high end, but on par with every great steakhouse. The steaks themselves are fantastic, but the sides are out of this world. If you're celebrating a birthday or anniversary, make sure to let your server know for a little something extra."
02/09/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Delicious food, excellent service- thanks to Chris K!"
02/09/2019,D2Gg,5.0,Couldn’t have been happier with our experience. The food was fantastic and they even got us out of there on time for the game.
02/09/2019,KristenS,5.0,This is our go to place for fine 5-star food. The staff are ALWAYS perfection and the food is ALWAYS delicious. We attend 2 times per month as our date night and birthday meals.
02/09/2019,AudreyB,5.0,Michael Jordan’s steakhouse never disappoints. We’ve been here 5 times and every time we are just as amazed. We decided to celebrate getting married here with an intimate dinner and Steve was amazing. He suggest some awesome dishes that veered us from our regular dishes and we were very happy with his suggestions. He was awesome. As always everything tasted great and was cooked to perfection. Never disappointed when eating here.
02/08/2019,GreatFood,3.0,Food was good but not worth the price in my opinion. Service was excellent.  It was excessively loud.
02/08/2019,Caleb,4.0,Overall a great experience. The beat part was the food. We both had steaks and they were amazing. It was a little noisy for the type of restaurant this is.
02/08/2019,KevinC,5.0,Jimmy was our server and his knowledge of the steak cuts was  incredible. His professionalism and service was great and highly recommended. If we ever come back to the Mohegan we will be sure to make a reservation at MJs.
02/08/2019,Jay1,2.0,Food was just average but came with a premium price.
02/07/2019,JeffM,4.0,Overall everything was great but it was way to dark in the restaurant. They need to turn up the lighting just a bit. It was hard to read the menu and was hard to see my steak when I was cutting it. The food and service was excellent.
02/07/2019,AnthonyB,5.0,Always awesome food and excellent service!!! Great side dishes and I liked the updates to the menu
02/07/2019,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Steak was excellent, mashed potatoes were instant made, killed my $200.00 dinner."
02/04/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great birthday date !! Definately will be back
02/03/2019,FrankA,5.0,Best waiter ever... Steve... also steak and lobster tail was amaizing
02/03/2019,Higgins,5.0,Steve our waiter was amazing. First class all the way. From check in to leaving needs no improvement. Everything was outstanding.
02/03/2019,SSGG,2.0,"We have eaten there 40+ times. I ordered the ribeye medium well. Came out raw. Took it back, left the side dishes. Came back 10 mins later like shoe leather. Side dishes now were cold. Brought us a glass of champagne for my birthday but manager made no attempt to come and ask how the meal was. Was unfortunate when spending a lot of money there!!"
02/02/2019,DavidP,4.0,"Always an excellent meal
A little off their game on quality this time"
02/02/2019,jwright,4.0,"The food was outstanding, as well as the service.  We could not have had a better waitress.  If we had a choice, we would have selected a better table, not all the way in the back corner abutting the emergency exit, but overall a fantastic experience."
01/31/2019,GiniM,5.0,"Setting up my reservation through Open Table was extremely easy and user friendly.  The hostess was very friendly and allowed us to come in earlier than our 8pm reservation.  Our server Adrian was wonderful.  She was very pleasant, courteous, knowledgeable and attentive.  The wedge salad and Caesar salads were delicious as were the the T-bone steak and NY Strip.  To top it off Adrian made my husband’s birthday special with a complementary dessert.  It was truly an unbelievable experience and I would recommend this restaurant to any and everyone.  The food, atmosphere and all of the staff made it an amazing and unforgettable birthday celebration for my husband."
01/28/2019,Thepash,5.0,MJ;s already fabulous. Last night was no exception. Rib eye was perfect
01/27/2019,Gmchef,5.0,"Place is consistently great, the hostess, the  bartenders, the waitstaff are top notch and well trained.
The steaks are cooked to perfection, the side dishes abundant and the drinks are always mixed exactly as ordered.
The prices are very reasonable for a casino restaurant, all well worth the price."
01/26/2019,DavidC,4.0,Can not rave enough about how great the staff was and  of course my wonderful Michael Jordans rib eye cooked to perfection. And to finish it off with a chocolate layer cake for my wife birthday thank you
01/26/2019,StevenL,4.0,The food was very good except for the asparagus. They were too fat. The waiter never asked how everything was. If he did I would have complained. His only concern was selling you something else. For the price the food should be out of this world.
01/26/2019,joannem,4.0,"Very noisy.  Tables for 2 seem to get less attention overall.  I had early reservations.  Left standing for too long waiting for my table.  Much confusion at the front desk.  Told 3 times to follow someone then told not to follow them.  Food was good.  Never really varies... Nothing surprising or intriguing for nightly specials.  Probably have dined her 50 times.  

They need some innovative offerings..."
01/26/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Fantastic food!! Waitress was phenomenal, food was prompt and delicious! Definitely going back!"
01/25/2019,FrankB,4.0,The food was great and well worth the price. I was told prior to going that the place was expensive but I have traveled a lot  and this place was worth the trip and money. No regrets at all and I would recommend it to anyone.
01/25/2019,ChristinaD,4.0,"The food is not consistent the way it’s cooked I went there 2 times, ordered same thing, 2 nd time it was awful"
01/25/2019,AdamV,5.0,I chose the rib eye.   It was phenomenal! It was cooked perfectly and I was able to cut through it like a hot knife cutting butter.   My wife and I drove 3.5 hours to dine at this fine establishment and we would definetly take the drive again.
01/23/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Each and every time we come to Jordan’s it is consistent. The food is amazing, the service(Brian, who we have had on multiple occasions) is always impeccable and we love the cocktails and variety of wine on the list- one of our favorites and a must do anytime we are at Mohegan"
01/21/2019,ShawnP,5.0,Great experience - service was perfect and my family loved it!  Long overdue!  As a CT Sports professional this was always a goal of mine -- to be able to go here with my family and enjoy a great steak and I was not disappointed.  The Filet was incredible.
01/21/2019,JamesS,4.0,Food was very good- had the porterhouse steak for two with mushrooms and baked potato-- mushrooms were out of this world; great mix. Service lagged and waitstaff disappeared though it was early and not very busy
01/21/2019,SemperFi,5.0,"MJ's is by far the best 'overall' restaurant at Mohegan Sun! Certainly the others are close but MJ's tops the list.
Service, atmosphere, food, and a reasonable wine list!"
01/20/2019,Dblsr,5.0,My birthday
01/20/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Haven’t had a bad meal here yet, service is always great too!"
01/19/2019,DeRog,5.0,"Excellent as always. Staff is professional, helpful and friendly. Food in fabulous, best steaks and all sides are large enough to share. Even salads should be shared so, you have enough room for the baked Alaska, creme Brule   or the 23 layer chocolate cake."
01/19/2019,RobertM,1.0,Very loud.  Not impressed with the atmosphere. Will not return!
01/18/2019,Michael,5.0,Always EXCELLENT SERVICE AND FOOD QUALITY.
01/16/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Great atmosphere and service, sat at the bar and Adrian took great care of us. Food and drinks were on point"
01/15/2019,CharlesR,3.0,They are back to sometimes GOOD and sometimes BAD. I am at I will only go if my wife really wants to go.  I had high hopes the last time I went and found out they had a New Chef and everything was GREAT.  This time the New Chef must have been off and we were Not Happy.
01/15/2019,SusanS,5.0,"Chris K, our server, once again made our evening special. He’s always attentive to our needs and makes us comfortable. The food is always awesome. Thanks again MJSH for a great night."
01/14/2019,PatriciaC,5.0,"We eat at Michael Jordan's every time we go to Mohegan Casino.  The food is always superior, cooked correctly and served in a timely manner  Waiters and waitresses have always provided excellent service."
01/14/2019,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"This is our favorite restaurant in CT. We have been here many, many times. We have found that Monday’s are not their best night, and you are selling yourself short if you choose a Monday. Try any other night."
01/14/2019,larrye,3.0,Food was excellent! The tables could use refinishing or table cloths.
01/13/2019,StephenA,5.0,Steak was excellent service was great.  Wouldve liked to have seen more Michael Jordan memorabilia and/or history about the restaurant name.
01/13/2019,ArtP,5.0,"Always greeted with a friendly smile, and always a fabulous dining experience! We celebrate every special occasion at Michael Jordan’s and any time we decide on a “date night” MJ’s is our “go to” restaurant choice!"
01/13/2019,FrankS,3.0,"We really like going to Michael Jordan's Steak House. this last visit was not the best. Food was great a 4 or 5. The service was a high 3 or 4. The issue we had was that we maid reservations, however it took over 30 minutes for us to get seated.

not sure the reservations helped."
01/12/2019,SAGE,3.0,"The steaks (the reason we were there) were excellent.  When I spend that much money, I'd love a table cloth.  It was very noisy and it was hard to have a quiet conversation.  Service was very good."
01/12/2019,MicheleH,5.0,"Jordan's never fails to impress! Drinks, service & of course the food are outstanding!"
01/12/2019,JaneD,5.0,food was just unbelievable...that Garlic bread fondue.......AHMAZING
01/12/2019,CindyS,3.0,"Steak was awesome! But was disappointed after showing a card which stated Birthday Dining dollars, was never wished a happy birthday by the server, would have been a nice touch."
01/10/2019,Nlmartin,5.0,Thank you so much for an excellent evening!  Everything was perfect!
01/10/2019,JustineS,5.0,Robert the server was wonderful. As usual food was outstanding

01/08/2019,Alt238,5.0,"Awesome food, great service and wonderful venue. Nice wine selection too. Don’t miss the opportunity to dine at Michael Jordan’s if you’re anywhere near Mohegan Sun. 
MSA"
01/07/2019,AndrewE,5.0,The food here s for the most part always excellent. I have been here n 5 separate occasions and on one the food was great but not excellent. The service and wine selections have always been top notch as well as the deserts. I would highly recommend. I would also suggest to the people that go here when your waitstaff provide great service be generous remember you’re not eating at Wendy’s!!
01/06/2019,RobertD,4.0,"I live in the area and have been to mohegan sun many, many times. Dinner for 3 was $350, no dessert, no coffee.  i realize dining at Casino is going to be expensive, catering to hotel guests, but this is no Peter Luger's. Beyond that, the food, service and atmosphere was very good."
01/05/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Wife’s Birthday
01/01/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,It was a great place for dinner on Mew Years. The food was amazing
01/01/2019,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Came here for NYE dinner - this place never disappoints!
01/01/2019,Ecjr1958,5.0,"Arrived 20 minutes prior to reservations,  it was New Years Eve. Full house , we were seated 10 minutes early , that was great. Our group was 5 persons with 2 teenagers. 
I had little trouble hearing due to ambient noise and hearing loss,  server was excellent and was able to explain the menu and answer all questions. Food was amazing,  steaks were juicy and cooked to order. The dining experience was one of the best ever. We will be back."
01/01/2019,RogerD,5.0,Was NYE dinner
01/01/2019,ChristyG,5.0,Awesome place...never disappoints!  I especially love the garlic bread and the NY Strip!  Don’t forget to order the mashed potatoes!
12/31/2018,ABSA,5.0,One of the best steak dinners my wife and I have ever had.  The service was very friendly and fantastic.  Will definitely go back...
12/31/2018,CharlesR,5.0,Our server Robert and Jorge are the best. We will be going back. Charlie & Kathy R.
12/31/2018,FrankieBoy,5.0,New Years Eve Dinner was exceptional. I have dined st Jordan’s for many years for many occasions and the food and service is Excellent. Great Steaks.
12/31/2018,StevenF,5.0,We visited on New Year's Eve and it was an excellent dining experience. The crab cake appetizer was the best I've ever tasted. The fillet mignon was tender and flavorful. Even the mashed potatoes were superb. Service was prompt and cheerful.
12/30/2018,KristenG,3.0,"Our server was excellent. Apps were great (crab cake and shrimp cocktail). However, the food runner attempted to serve us our $92 porterhouse with truffle crust (it clearly smelled like truffle and he was insistent that it was the blue cheese crust we ordered; by the way I have an allergy which I had alerted our server at the time we ordered). We informed our server who was apologetic and quickly worked to resolve the issue. Manager came to speak with us. Never introduced himself. Very awkward. The steak we did receive was borderline charred. Overall, we give it a 3, only because our server was excellent. Next time we will save date night for one of the competitors."
12/30/2018,CarolB,5.0,The night was amazing:) our server Dan was very informative! Meal and service superb!!
12/30/2018,914FoodConnoisseur,5.0,Great meal. Server was awesome. Truffle parm crust is amazing.
12/30/2018,Blklab,5.0,Nancy was great!
12/30/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great service. Amazing food
12/30/2018,scotchnlobster,3.0,"Michael, refurbish to eliminate the smell of aged beef fat and truffle oil.  Replace all but a dozen worn tables, and create more intimacy.  Skip ""domestic Wagyu:"" Sinewy!  Bone-in ribeye cooked perfectly. Tighten up on the mealy shrimp cocktail and offer a variety of oysters.  Just a little peanut oil in the tallow and fry potatoes twice for crispiness.  Caesar salad fantastic.  Creamed spinach also fantastic.  Decent pour on the Johnnie Walker, could be a drop heavier.  Service fantastic.  

Dave '84"
12/29/2018,Foodieyumyum,5.0,Fabulous in every way. Can’t wait to return!
12/28/2018,TiffInFL,3.0,"Nothing special. Ate there in 2009 after I won a jackpot and had forgotten how blah it was. Only went this trip because my teenage boys thought it sounded cool. They were disappointed in the lack of MJ memorabilia and in the food. Not horrible, but definitely not worth the $$. We had to ask for a server after sitting at the table for awhile. And then ask for water refills, etc. for those prices I expect a full glass of water! (It’s all the kids were drinking after one soda each) Won’t be back. (And yes...they went to the bathroom so they could see the memorabilia in the bar style side)"
12/28/2018,LizR,5.0,exceptional wait staff at Mohegan Sun never disappoints!  Been back twice in the past month.  Just wish there were more fish options.  I don't even eat meat and I love this place!!!!!
12/28/2018,CarolB,5.0,"Love everything about Michael Jordan’s....great for a special occasion, Business meeting, Fate, friend getting togather and everyday dining!!! The greatest restaurants!"
12/28/2018,adrianb,5.0,Excellent  atmosphere service food and ambiance .  Would return and recommend
12/28/2018,MariaS,5.0,"Great food & service , play slots before you go 😛a bit pricy but you are at the casino.    Everything Ala cart"
12/27/2018,JohnW,5.0,Expensive but worth it. Top flight food and drink.
12/27/2018,Rachel,5.0,Steak was out of this world and the service was incredible.
12/27/2018,DonnaC,4.0,The garlic bread fondue was excellent as well as the steaks we had.  Service was excellent.
12/26/2018,WayneM,4.0,"We are usually very pleased with the dining experience at Michael Jordan's. However, this time both the ambience and the food (a first) were disappointing.  Typically a quiet and mellow place to dine, this evening  we were seated several tables away from a very loud and annoying group that really disrupted our diner. We weren't alone as all of the diners around us were giving the rude table dirty looks.  Unfortunately, the staff did nothing to quiet them down. 

We had the meatball appetizer which was perfect as usual, my wife had a lobster entree which she thought was excellent  and I ordered the Szechuan pepper crusted tuna which was a mistake. I have always ordered steak at MJ's and i has always been perfect. Not so the tuna. While it was prepared as ordered (rare) that was the only positive. The tuna was unseasoned, with little or no taste. I saw no evidence of peppercorns or taste of smoking.  I had to ask the server for a bit of wasabi to liven up the bland piece of mushy fish.  I did not finish the medium sized portion.  

Next time I'll know better and order a steak!"
12/25/2018,roberth,4.0,"Wonderful dining experience.....service ,quality of the food outstanding"
12/25/2018,ArtC,5.0,"Best steak i had in a while. The atmosphere  was great, very polite waitress."

12/25/2018,Foodie,4.0,Annual Family Tradition
12/25/2018,DylanH,3.0,Way overpriced. We had much better steak and paid half of the price.
12/24/2018,Skullster,4.0,"Terrific good, noisy atmosphere. Way too noisy for high end restaurant but good food and service."
12/24/2018,ChuckA,5.0,"The food was excellent.  I had a pork chop and my wife had a petite fillet.  The creamed spinach was the icing on the cake.  Had clams, oysters and shrimp cocktail as appetizer.  All cooking temperatures were perfect."
12/24/2018,PierreR,5.0,"Great food, our server and the others were fantastic. No issues at all with the service. My wife thoroughly enjoyed her steak. Will go back again soon with friends."
12/24/2018,Jeff,5.0,Wonderful food and service! Great job Amanda Marshall and her staff!
12/23/2018,THEBUTLER,5.0,Another wonderful evening at Michael Jordans. Very attentive service. Food cooked to order.  the Kansas City sirloin and baked Alaska were superb.
12/22/2018,KenS,5.0,My wife and I have been there twice in the last couple of months and have been extremely pleased with both visits. The food is excellent and the service is very good.
12/22/2018,SherryR,5.0,It’s always a pleasure to see Amanda. She’s always so attentive and a great host. We had Monique  for a server for the first time and she was excellent I like to thank the whole staff and wish them a Merry Christmas.! The hostess Jayleen is also wonderful and a pleasure to see.
12/22/2018,JimmyD,4.0,"Service and entrees/appetizers are top notch.  The steaks are dry-aged for 28 days, and absolutely perfect. Unfortunately, the ambiance is that of a family dining hall, extremely loud to the point of deafening.   Conversations across the table are nearly impossible. The clientele is quite varied, as all manner of gambler types are dining, from the loud ball cap wearing adult males in pullover sweatshirts and louder women in tight jeans, to men in suits and/or jackets and women dressed professionally.  Luck of the draw who you get seated near."
12/22/2018,chris,5.0,MJ's is the best of the best! Quality is always 100%. They do not cut corners! Get the carrots - their unbelievably great!!
12/22/2018,JosephU,5.0,As usual a great meal with great service   Will definitely eat there again and again
12/21/2018,AnnetteG,2.0,"Very unhappy with the food this time.  Crab was rancid, and the couple of us that touched it before we smelled it, had stinky hands the rest of the night it was so bad.  The wagyu beef was sub par and tasted worse than a choice piece of beef, it was very tough too.  We did enjoy the crab cake appetizer and the sides.

The manager was ""sorry"" but it did not seem genuine.

We have been here many times before, not sure if we will give another try."
12/19/2018,CharlesR,5.0,Everything was great (in my opinion the potato was under cooked)
12/18/2018,TinaC,4.0,"It was my husbands birthday. The team did a great job reading my notes on my opentable reservation and accommodating. The server was only ok, could have been better. She never told us specials, never asked us if we wanted bread, never asked us if we wanted another drink. The Kansas steak was delicious my short ribs was only ok. Sauce was a little thick and noodles were stuck together. Seafood platter was very good."
12/17/2018,PatriciaC,5.0,"The waiter was efficient, offered us additional rolls if we wanted and checked on us throughout the meal.

The food was fantastic.  My petite filet was cooked to perfection and you could have cut it with a regular knife.  Our fries had a very good taste.  My husband's rib eye was excellent according to him.

When we visit Mohegan we always go to Michael Jordan's for a meal we know we will enjoy."
12/16/2018,GaryA,5.0,"Always great service combined with great food, always pleased."
12/16/2018,EdGen,5.0,"My wife and I had a wonderful porterhouse for 2, accompanied by a red wine and finished off with the bomb for dessert. Burrata cheese with pickled plum salad was very good as well.  Our waiter Jimmy was outstanding as well and knew the menu inside and out."
12/16/2018,PeterZ,4.0,I went for my birthday and it was very busy. I requested a booth a few weeks ahead of time but once again I didn’t get one. The service was excellent and so was the food. We had drinks before we went in for dinner. It’s a little pricey but overall really good.
12/15/2018,VickiK,5.0,"We are never disappointed with Michael Jordan's.  The steaks are terrific and I had double cut lamp chops and they were DEVINE.  I was disappointed that the Clam Chowder had been removed from the menu.  I was really looking forward to it.  Our server Jules said it was not on the menu any longer and when we asked for the beet salad, she said it was delicious, and it was excellent, our friends had the Caesar salad and they said it was delicious so all in all, another GREAT dinner !!"
12/15/2018,gardener,5.0,My 2nd time there but definitely not my last. Food is outstanding and wonderful service as well
12/15/2018,Surprised,5.0,Chris and Eddie provided great service throughout the meal. Very attentive to our needs. The meal was great. Filets very tender and flavorful.

12/15/2018,MatthewY,5.0,Service was top notch and the flight of beef was spectacular
12/15/2018,Kimu2fan,4.0,Great tasting steak and short rib. Prices a bit high and a little noisy for what I expected for the price. Wait staff was fantastic!
12/14/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,old Friends getting together
12/14/2018,JT524,5.0,Great steak and sides. My husband and I truly enjoyed our meal. A bit pricey but actually more affordable than other steak houses I’ve been to recently. I’d definitely recommend this restaurant
12/09/2018,DanB,5.0,Food was excellent. Food servers knowledge was outstanding especially regarding wine list. Highly recommended.
12/09/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Special dinner for our Anniversary & the food didn’t disappoint. The free dessert for our anniversary, however, was very bland and dry. I was also surprised for such a high end restaurant to have plain brown to go bags for our leftovers. A restaurant like Michael Jordan’s should have nice branded bags & containers."
12/09/2018,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Amazing service, my waiter was great. Everyone there is incredibly friendly. The food however, not so great. Waiter recommended the ribeye, highly disappointed."
12/09/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Once again, a delicious dinner ! We were a table of seven and everyone enjoyed their meal. The Rob Eye and Strip steak were delicious. I look forward to coming here again!"
12/08/2018,LoriP,4.0,"We ate here before show at arena, the servers were excellent, our meals were delicious. You don’t get a lot of food for the price but definitely it’s worth the trip if you are at Mohegan for a night."
12/08/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,My daughter’s birthday
12/07/2018,IleneF,4.0,"As a frequent MJ patron at Mohegan Sun, I can attest that the service and food is consistently very good.  The waitvstaf is friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating.  The food is high quality steakhouse fare with ample portions, seasonal specials and a varied wine accompaniment.  A wonderful dining experience!"
12/07/2018,MikeO,4.0,I've been going here for years but this time the food wasn't as good as it should be for the prices they charge. Both our steaks were over cooked and not very palatable. I am not one to complain but when the manager stopped by I did mention my wife's filet was way too over cooked and he did comp it for us so at least that was a positive.
12/06/2018,EamonG,5.0,Just a real excellent place for food. I have eaten almost everything on the Menu and always been very satisfied. Staff is great and also an amazing wine list.
12/06/2018,PatriciaS,3.0,"Staff was great, food not so much... We ordered the $92 porterhouse for 2 with some apps (not included) and some meatballs. The meatballs were delish and so was the bluecheese fondue bread. I have to be honest when it come sot the steak because after all, that's what its all about when you dine at a steakhouse. They brought the steak out already cut,m which completely sucked because all of the juices were gone and the steak was dry. We also orderd medium rare and my portion, the filet side, was done. I think it was because after they cut it, it appeared to be broiled with the bone sticking up, fancy like, to brown it with the steak. This also dried the meat. And the garlic bulb on the side of the meat was cold. So, I had a $92 steak that was overcooked, dry, and has cold accompaniments. Not how I thought my husbands birthday dinner was going to go. Honestly, I would save my cash and go to LongHorn if you are looking for a nicely done porterhouse for two. I have had it a few times and it melts in your mouth and is everything you would want it to be and more. Sorry Micheal Jordan, but you, missed the mark on this one."
12/06/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"My birthday dinner . It was awesome !! Thank you for birthday dessert . Outstanding service , always pleased"
12/05/2018,PatriciaC,5.0,"We go to Michael Jordan's Steak House every time we go to Mohegan Casino.
Your beef is amazing.  The petite filet is just the right size for me and is always cooked to perfection.  I think you could cut it with a table knife if needed.  My husband really enjoys your rib eye steak.
Waiters/waitresses are always courteous and friendly.  Service is great with a waiter or assistant coming to the table in a timely manner.
Overall I just can't go to other restaurants at the casino since I know I will get ""the best meal"" at Michael Jordan's."
12/04/2018,Eddd,5.0,"The entire staff is great: from reception, the table busing folks and the waiters & waitress'.  Our waitress Danielle is wonderful and really at the top of her game.  She just does it all with ease.  The assistant GM -- Amanda is also outstanding in every way.  MJ's steakhouse is lucky to have theses great people! It's because of them we keep coming back.

12/01/2018,EyalG,4.0,"While the steaks we ordered were very expensive as expected and were pretty tasty (not warm enough though) mashed potatoes and asparagus were also very expensive. 
It was a good experience but not one to be repeated any time soon."
12/01/2018,JasonD,5.0,Dimly lit restaurant with great staff and a menu that perfectly describes what you’re in for.  Chris K did an outstanding job waiting on us and Jamie was like a ninja refilling my water and clearing our table as we ate.   Desert was on point though I had to order it to go as the portions were large.
12/01/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Especially loved the velvet booth!
12/01/2018,CynthiaJ,5.0,"Food, service, prices and atmosphere....OUTSTANDING!!!! This restaurant EXCEEDED my expectations. I will definitely be going back."
11/27/2018,Ninasmom,4.0,"Unfortunately the steak  this time was disappointing. Ordered rare on the medium side it came more medium. In addition, it was not as tender or flavorful as ones we've there in the past. The creamed spinich, however, was outstanding , service most enjoyable and recognition of our anniversary much appreciated."
11/27/2018,SusanS,5.0,Chris K our server made our evening great. Food as always was outstanding.
11/26/2018,CesarSalad,5.0,"Steaks, better than great. Service fabulous. Creme brûlée not so good."
11/26/2018,Carol,4.0,"If roasted carrots are offered as a side dish, they should be roasted to the point at which you can cut them with a fork.  I almost couldn't cut them with a knife!  And if you are going to make a martini with pumpkin puree -DON'T.  The drink separated in the course of the meal into a semi-solid top and a liquid orange bottom."
11/25/2018,Camk,5.0,"The service the night we were dining was outstanding as we were on a schedule to attend concert.  Food was amazing as well as selection of bottled wines, which we entertained a Frank Family Red Cab.  A perfect compliment to the evening!!"

11/25/2018,PAMR,4.0,we enjoyed a great meal for our anniversery and also saw a show after.  The servers were great The food excellent as my husband and his  buddies are steak connoisseurs.  The extra  touches for our anniversery were nice.
11/25/2018,JulioR,4.0,Great food but a very pricey wine list! That was not very good because the steak required a really good bottle of wine that's definitely less than $150-200!!
11/24/2018,KeriP,5.0,"The steak was delicious, melt in your mouth. The service was outstanding."
11/24/2018,GaryT,5.0,Excellent service. The food was outstanding and steaks prepared perfectly!
11/24/2018,Manny,5.0,Food was great. We celebrated our anniversary and they greeted us so nicely. Polite and informed staff. We had the crab cakes they were tasty and I can’t wait to have them the next time we go back. For the main course we had a bone in ribeye which was cooked perfectly and it was so juicy. The delmonico is the steak to have here. It was FANTASTIC! We are looking forward to our next visit . We were also given a complimentary champagne toast in honor of our celebration. Very nice touch.
11/24/2018,ilanj,3.0,"We’ve always loved having dinner at Michael Jordan’s. The food and service is always impeccable. Not this time. Our waitress was inattentive. We were waiting forever for our food and then it was served cold. They did remake our food, but now that was another wait. Definitely not the expectation when you’re paying $600+ for a meal. Very disappointed!"
11/23/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Whent to Mohegan sun for my 30th birthday with my girlfriends  went to Michael Jordan’s steak house got a few drinks is and a flight of steak with some sides it was amazing best food I’ve ever had

11/21/2018,TedS,4.0,"Originally had a reservation for Bar Americain but decided to switch to MJs since we haven’t been in a while.  It was a night out without the kids.  Started with the garlic bread, which I highly recommend and the crab and lobster bisque.  Also very good.  Decided to go with the porterhouse for two, cooked medium.  The steak was good except that the filet part was a bit overdone/cooked unevenly.  You would expect a steakhouse to get the temperature right, especially on a $92 steak.  Had two sides, the corn off the cob and the mashed potato trio.  Both were average at best.  Finished it off with the baked Alaska which was fantastic.  Overall a nice meal but will probably not return."
11/20/2018,PaulS,5.0,Great food and service. Excellent sides as well. The staff was very attentive.  They have gluten free options

The presentation was excellent. All the selections were flavorful and the tastes were diverse and intriguing. First class all the way and worth the money. The dinner was $223 and is meant to share with another person."

11/10/2018,Shirl,4.0,"Fun time at Michael Jordan's steakhouse at Mohegan Sun.  We had dinner there before seeing Josh Groban in concert.  It is a very noisy place - but - the food is yummy and the service was very nice.  The ladies at the ""check in"" counter are very nice and accommodating.  I mentioned in our Opentable reservation that it was our anniversary and they gave us 2 flutes of champagne and seated us in a quieter room in the back so we were actually able to speak with one another. 

The steaks were yummy - we shared a Caesar salad which was plenty for 2 - too large if you are having it by yourself - the mac and cheese side dish was yummy too. 

Thanks for a nice experience!!"
11/10/2018,NoelleC,5.0,Monquie our waitress was charming and gave perfect suggestions for dinner   Food was incredible tasty   Best crab legs we have ever had

11/10/2018,JoeS,5.0,"We had an early reservation and were pleasantly surprised. Our waitperson was very friendly but professional and very helpful with the dinner choices. Since it was really a late lunch/early dinner we didn't feel like a huge meal. There were 3 of us and we each had a salad, shared a porterhouse steak (3 ways) and ordered 3 side dishes. It was more than enough food. The restaurant was very accommodating even though we only ordered one entree. The steak was cooked to perfection and everything was delicious!"

Steve, our waiter (and the entire wait staff) was terrific.  The food, wine list and and ambience all made for a terrific evening.  They accommodated us for my wife’s birthday and even made her a dish that is no longer on the menu!  Super gracious of them and not soon forgotten!"

We had the bone-in filet and the bone-in rib-eye which were mouth watering and cooked to perfection. The corn off the cob was buttery and spicy and paired perfectly with the steak and the additional side of asparagus with shaved parmesan. 

We could not leave without ordering dessert. And Chris also recommended the Baked Alaska. It was outstanding. The velvety smooth ice cream with caramel and almonds and the marshmallow topping was the prefect way to end our delicious dinner. We are looking forward to our next visit."
11/04/2018,ErinA,5.0,Our server Dan was incredibly professional and courteous. He was very knowledgeable and helped us decide what to order.

All of the staff is so friendly and attentive.
11/03/2018,tristenu,5.0,"Everything you would expect from a traditional fine dining steakhouse. We ordered the porterhouse for two and it was cooked to perfection of medium rare.  We had their new recipe macaroni and cheese on the side and it was creamy and very flavorful.  We also wanted to start with a lighter less filling appetizer and our waitress Julie was helpful in selecting the lobster dumplings, which were a definite hit.  Overall it was exactly what we were expecting and bit more."

11/02/2018,AlanaD,3.0,"Very busy. Arrived early for our reservation, said they can’t seat us until reservation time.  Didn’t seat us until 15 min later. Had to hound them to get seated.

Everything I tasted was exceptional, especially the Alaskan crab my husband ordered!!!  Mix in a friendly, attentive, well informed server and you can't ask for a better dining experience! (Hope to be seated with John S.)! My only complaint is that this establishment is too far from home!"

Tense why she came over and asked how everything was when we were 3/4 threw it . My Potato was Luke warm at most , everything for the top of the potato was cold served to me , and the steak for 52 dollars while good  could be replaced at a chain steak house for half the cost and be the same, or better .  For our anniversary and the cost it could be so
Much better , lesson learned Texas Roadhouse next time or even longhorn"

On the other hand, I order my stake well done and it was burned. It tasted like charcoal in my mouth. I did not return it because I wanted to appear cool. But when my girl tasted it, she felt sorry for me. I told my coworkers at work that I had a great time. But my girl who is a nurse told her friends what happened to me and how bad she felt because I wanted to go to David Burke. In the end I am happy because my girl was very happy."

We also enjoyed the tuna tartare appetizer and the sides which we shared including mashed potato trio and roasted asparagus 

The beef eaters martinis were great but strong so maybe stick to one and as it was our anniversary they gave us two free champagne glasses (unexpected)

I would definitely go back."

Only disappointment was even with reservation we were put in a table in the middle would have appreciated something more private since it was dinner for two. It was my first time there so I was not familiar with the seating to ask."
09/28/2018,SherryR,5.0,Amanda amazing Jen is a server Amanda is the manager there beautiful smiles and the excellent service makes you have an amazing time.
09/24/2018,JeremyC,5.0,My wife and I had an excellent night out. our server Christopher Torrez provided us the best service you could ask for.
09/23/2018,huge,5.0,Manager and our waiter made our special occasion memorable
09/23/2018,TonyJ,5.0,Been there 20x or more. The food has always been perfect.
09/23/2018,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Food was good, wine list was decent, noise level was obnoxiously loud"
09/23/2018,Christopher,5.0,"Treated like I owned the place. Amazing food. Treated to the chefs special, was hands down best meal I've ever had!"
09/23/2018,Bobbi,4.0,"Our waiter was great, the food is a bit over priced for what you get. Our water glasses got refilled no problem but we were never asked if a refill was wanted for our drinks. The chicken breast meal was a bit tough. Not much seasoning. Would of thought there would of been a little more reference  to Michael Jordan throughout the restaurant."
09/22/2018,Mayumi99,5.0,"It was the perfect place to satisfy our craving for steak!  My friends and I all ordered the Ribeye.  There was a perfectly seared crust in the steak that gave us that “wow” bite each time.  The Mashed Potato trio was to die for, as was the garlic bread where the server pours a cheese fondue around the plate for us to dip the bread.  We could have licked the plate clean (but refrained from doing so, of course, since we’re ladies!).  The server gave us complimentary glasses of champagne and also surprised us with a little chocolate cake for our birthday celebration.  We had to decline ordering dessert since we were so stuffed from dinner but it was such a sweet gesture!
We would go back there again when we are in the area again, for sure!"
09/21/2018,MichaelD,3.0,Way too loud and felt rushed to get us out.  Server forgot salads.  When reminding her the entrees were brought out and she simply said “no worries. I’ll just take the salads off the bill” and walked away.  Was less than thrilled. MJ’s used to be special-  not anymore.
09/20/2018,Sweeneyct,5.0,"From the bartender to the servers to the manager who came around to say hello, all fantastic.  Meals were fantastic as always."
09/20/2018,KeithJ,5.0,"Young ladies at the reception desk were very pleasant and accommodating.  
Food was great as usual"
09/20/2018,JonP,4.0,Excellent steakhouse and option for upscale meal at Mohegan. Pricey but overall worth it for sure.
09/20/2018,Longtimecutomer,5.0,Great rib- eye steak. Great baked potato.  Will make veggies to order if you ask.
09/19/2018,CourtneyC,5.0,We had an amazing experience for my boyfriends birthday. The food and ambiance we’re absolutely perfect!
09/18/2018,SusanS,5.0,"Dan, our server, was as always very attentive. He helped my non red meat eater put together a meal using Caesar salad and appetizers. It was great!  MJ’s now serves white anchovies. Great addition!"
09/17/2018,RafaelC,5.0,This place is great. The wife and I came for our anniversary!!!
09/16/2018,Joseph,3.0,"The shrimp cocktails were a little soft, not what you expect at $19 for four shrimp, my steak was good but not up to its usual standard"
09/16/2018,Eastcoastfoodie,5.0,30th wedding anniversary dinner. They went the extra mile for us. Loved the champagne toast! Seating was perfect
09/16/2018,KoriK,5.0,Food was amazing and the service was great. Cant wait to go back
09/15/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Great time, amazing food!"
09/14/2018,Sandy23,5.0,The service was outstanding during a recent trip to Michael Jordan's. The food was also very good. We love the garlic bread appetizer. Enjoyed our salads and main meals. I had the salmon which was tasty. The multi layer chocolate cake is a treat. This is an expensive restaurant and worthy of special occasions.
09/09/2018,RalphP,5.0,"We went there to celebrate a birthday.  The filet was very tender and tasty.   The garlic bread was amazing, a must have for all visits there."
09/09/2018,Tropical,4.0,This restaurant is there for some time but I have to say the quality of the products is excellent. The beef was very good and all other products good too. I had to wait a little long to get my main dish but the manger apologized and also deducted a glas of wine from my bill. Very good service! It’s a very good steak house.
09/09/2018,allisony,5.0,Girls weekend away
09/09/2018,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"I brought a friend to experience what I have always enjoyed, a great meal!!!
This time the steak was hard to cut and the lobster tail was undercooked.  I called about this and left a message with the manager and never received a call back. 
Will go back though."
09/08/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"It was our 1 year wedding anniversary and requested a booth.  Although it is not a guarantee that the request will be granted, they were able to accommodate us.  They also provided us with complimentary champagne at the end of the night.   We didn't feel any pressure to hurry our meal and move on.  The staff was delightful and the food was perfect!  We had a fabulous night."
09/08/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Amazing service and food
09/08/2018,JenniferB,5.0,Michael Jordan’s never disappoints. Always a good bet for a pre concert meal at Mohegan sun. Steaks were delicious and cooked to perfection.
09/08/2018,GiGi,5.0,"As always, the service, ambiance and food are top notch! We continue to choose MIchael Jordan's Steak House for each occasion at Mohegan Sun and they never disappoint!"
09/08/2018,RogerB,5.0,Best garlic bread I have ever had. Filet was awesome as well as baked potato.
09/08/2018,SandyM,5.0,"My husband and I love a good steakhouse.  We have enjoyed great meals at quite a few high end steakhouses in our travels.  We agree that Michael Jordan's is a five star restaurant in all that would be expected from a high end steakhouse. Very, very good! Looking forward to the next time!"
09/07/2018,SherryR,5.0,"Everything was perfect tonight, Amanda is Amazing   she brightens the whole place with her beautiful welcoming smile we also had a great server Jen ,Who is experienced and knows the whole menu and she brightens up the place as well thank you. Oysters Were delicious and the Kansas City strip steak is one of my favorites and my husband loves the Tell Monaco steak"
09/07/2018,Daisy246,5.0,"Love this restaurant! Garlic bread with Maytag blue cheese always a must! Both of us had the stuffed lobster, tender and sweet with a great stuffing mixture. Creamed spinach also the best!"
09/07/2018,ThomasD,5.0,"Very happy, great food and  great  Value for the Quality of food."
09/07/2018,kmack,5.0,"Were attending a concert at Mohegan Sun Arena and had dinner at Michael Jordan's prior to the show. We were seated within ten minutes of our reservation time and hostess was friendly and polite. Our meals were excellent, a bone-in ribeye and a grilled Halibut. We shared two sides, a loaded baked potato and creamed spinach and both were delicious. Topped off the meal with an Irish Coffee and a piece of cheesecake which was also excellent. All in all, a great meal, a little bit pricey but nonetheless excellent."
09/07/2018,JodieM,5.0,Always outstanding!!! Never go to Mohegan Sun without having dinner at Michael Jordan’s.
09/06/2018,SusanM,4.0,"The service was great, drinks and sides delicious! Our steaks were way too salty, really took away from our enjoyment of them. Not sure why all the salt. Very nice touch to give us a free dessert for our special occasion."
09/04/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,20th Anniversary
09/03/2018,Yummyfood,5.0,"Food was outstanding! From appetizers, entrees to dessert. The service was amazing and dan our waiter was great. They did a fantastic job making our special night even more special. Thank you!!"
09/02/2018,MARKD,4.0,"I ate here on labor day weekend back to back nights. I really enjoy a good steak and I think MJs have some of the best around. I had a 10 ounce filet with a blue cheese crust and it was perfect both nights. The mash potato assortment is below par. You used to be able to order a full dish of lobster mash years ago. It is no longer an option and I don’t recommend ordering. I enjoyed the sautéed mushrooms which I had both nights. We ordered the small $59 shellfish platter the first night and it was pretty good and I’d recommend it. Service is decent but below par against good area steakhouses like Capital Grille. You won’t get a lot of love from your wait staff and you typically do when dropping $450 for a meal for 4 (and we barely drank). Don’t expect the manager to say hi. Don’t expect the waiter to whip out the crumb stick to discard your bread droppings. Some of the host staff is also below average. The second night we asked to sit at the bar and the host said it will just be a few minutes to clean the table. We waited in front of the host stand for someone to come and tell us it was ready. However the host decided to seat someone else there. She explained to us it was first come first served on tables. Ummmm...but we were first. She said we should’ve waited right next to it. How pompous can you get?  She is lucky another table opened up because I would’ve have lost my mind on the spot.  She basically blamed us for not knowing her secret rules. Overall I come here for the food and a steakhouse atmosphere is preferable to me over Ballo and Tuscany.  I have been coming here for 15+ years and I do enjoy it and I guess I just know what to expect when I come. My advice on ordering is don’t over order. Between large apps, bread, drinks, etc it leaves you very little room to finish off a large steak and sides which is a shame to discard part of a $50+ steak."
09/01/2018,Gingee,3.0,We eat at Michael Jordan’s practically every time we stay at Mohegan Sun. We have decided to stop pretending that we can get a good steak here. Despite the same pricing as other steakhouses Michael Jordan’s does not deliver the same quality beef.  My husband’s ribeye was half gristle. He has experienced the same problem several times before but sometimes we get a decent steak (not exceptional) so we keep trying. My stuffed lobster was disappointing as well. Maybe no more tries for this location.
09/01/2018,henryr,5.0,Love it.  A little loud. Food is good. Service excellent.
09/01/2018,VinnieChi,5.0,"The service, drinks and food were above my expectations. The front of the restaurant was very noisy, but the back was quieter.
It’s a bit of a walk to the restrooms.
Leisurely meal as it should be with these prices. A special treat clearly. The rib eye and lamb chops were cooked just right."
09/01/2018,DebraS,5.0,We celebrated our anniversary here and had a wonderful dinner. Everything from the garlic bread to the filet mignon was delicious. It’s expensive but was top quality and perfect for a special occasion. Service was prompt and friendly.
09/01/2018,DecellT,3.0,"Food was good, not anything exceptional.. Just average."
09/01/2018,PhyllisG,5.0,"Michael Jordan’s can’t be beat for great food and service.  It’s a bit noisy when crowded and a bit pricey, but well worth it."
09/01/2018,PAULIE,5.0,JULIE THE WAITRESS TERRIFIC--ALSO GIRLS AT DESK   THE BEST
08/31/2018,AnnemarieS,5.0,"Always great food. A little $$$ 
Service is always impeccable 
Can be a little loud
Good for groups"
08/31/2018,Foodie,5.0,We were late to our reservation because the casino parking was a mess. They still got us to a table quickly and service was excellent. The food is very good and the atmosphere is usual steak house. Good solid meal.
08/31/2018,JimM,5.0,"This was our first visit to the Mohegan Sun and Michael Jordan’s Steakhouse. I chose this for a special occasion and they did not disappoint. We started with the Garlic Bread appetizer, then moved on to a Caesar salad. I chose the New York strip and the wife got the Loster and Crab. We chose to split a side of the Mac and cheese. Everything from beginning to end and from the service to the food was excellent. We will definitely return in the future."
08/31/2018,JessicaM,5.0,Excellent food! The bone marrow butter was out do this world. I always compare steakhouses to the capital grille and I have to say this meal was amazing!
08/30/2018,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Salty soup, steaks over cooked our server seemed to be either stretched to thin or not caring as plates sat around. 
I told the restaurant when they confirmed our reservation we where celebrating our wedding in 4 days with some friends. No special ambience was provided. 

We had a good experience previously hope it was an off night"
08/30/2018,LarissaM,5.0,"I’ve eaten at Michael Jordan’s before and the food is always very good, but the service this time was exceptional. It was our wedding anniversary and I specified in the notes of the reservation that it was and that we would like a quiet/private table. Usually restaurants ignore these notes, but Michael’s went above and beyond our expectations. They not only complied with our request, but also acknowledged that it was our anniversary verbally, in a nice card, and even brought over two complimentary glasses of champagne. We will be back to celebrate another anniversary with them!"
08/30/2018,NoCookThursdays,4.0,Enjoy perfectly cooked steaks and baked potato.  I had short ribs which were so tender serve over truffle fettacine.  My boyfriend has a medium rate ribeye and baked potato.  Good tap selection and wine list.  A bit pricey but you won't be disappointed.
08/28/2018,Grandma,5.0,"This what a steakhouse should be. They are spot on with cooking to the exact order. Great meat with nice seasoning. Could use better bread, but that’s a personal thing."
08/27/2018,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"As always, never disappointed by the garlic bread 😉 all of our food was perfectly cooked and the service was spot on!"
08/26/2018,JoeD,4.0,"From the start the food was excellent, the bread, salad and Main Corse was all very good. If you really enjoy steak, I would highly recommend trying MJ’s."
08/26/2018,LeslieA,5.0,"Food was amazing,  the only comment I would have, is the pasta for Mac and cheese was undercooked, I like aldente, but this was definitely undercooked.. Tasty though.. Great service, loved it!!!!  Highly recommend. Thank you!"
08/25/2018,IlyssaC,3.0,Very nice restaurant. Great dirty martini. Excellent side dishes. I loved the creamed spinach and my husband likes the mushrooms. He also loved his meatball appetizer. The issue is the steak itself.  We ordered the porterhouse and it was very small. I’ve been to many NYC steakhouses and this $92 porterhouse was small and not very tasty. It was also over cooked.  It’s a shame because everything else was very good.
08/25/2018,Terri,5.0,"Excellent staff. I’d called to say we’d be late, which ended up being about 30 minutes and they were very accommodating. Much appreciated on a busy Saturday night. Wait staff was amazing and attentive also."
08/25/2018,ArielN,5.0,"Excellent food, I love th wine list and the bourbon list. 
Place was nice and quiet. 

Great time."
08/25/2018,HitesMites,4.0,"We really enjoyed our meal and the service at Michael Jordan's Steak House.  Relaxing environment, good food."
08/25/2018,DateNight,5.0,"Chris K., our waiter, was very pleasant and helpful, just an all around great server!!  He knew about all the menu, what foods were favored among others. Great experience, phenomenal food and would definitely return!!"
08/25/2018,RichardW,5.0,My wife and I enjoy dining here regularly.  The food is amazing and the prices are reasonable. Also the staff is superb.
08/25/2018,WahndaM,5.0,"Great first time experience! The waiter/s made the visit  phenomenal! He/they were very patient,  knowledgeable of both the food and beverage menus, provided a level of comfort through conversation and the food and drinks were delicious. Too full for dessert.."
08/24/2018,PaulB,5.0,The steak I had had to be the best tasting and cooked unbelievably perfect
08/24/2018,ChristopherC,5.0,Enjoyed some high quality prime steaks. The Delmonico was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. The crab cake app is outstanding. Our service was fantastic as well. We will defiantly return when we are looking for a five star dining Steakhouse.
08/24/2018,FredS,5.0,"Not our first visit there, but we Dined there for our 28th wedding anniversary.  I requested a booth for something a little more cozy and private, and they accommodated us.  The manager brought us an anniversary card, and two glasses of champagne on the house. The food was fantastic as usual.   All the wait staff wished us a happy anniversary.   Memorable dining experience."
08/24/2018,Aljr,4.0,"My go to at Mohegan...never disappointed,  Garlic bread.. Fantastic! Ceasar salad...good,
Ribeye amazing! Trio of mashed excellent! ,23 layer cake Off the hook!!! Service superb however a little rushed this time.
We'll be back!"
08/23/2018,DebbieT,5.0,As always my meal was spectacular. I’ve dined here on several occasions and everytime everything’s been on point. I highly recommend!
08/23/2018,Capital,2.0,Wasn’t worth the $390 we spent for 2 people....unfortunately
08/19/2018,pegfromupstate,5.0,"This is one of our all-time favorite places. Always outstanding specials, attentive service. Would go there more often if we lived closer."
08/19/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"When we got to the restaurant, we were sat within a minute... the hostess pulled out our table so we can comfortably get into the booth and then presented the birthday girl with a card from Michael Jordan (which was so thoughtful- even if it is a copy or not)! The staff was wonderful and the food was good. Had 3 steaks and 1 salmon (salmon was supposed to be cooked medium and it was a little on the well side), the garlic bread tower was AMAZING and the sides were ok (mashed potato trio - all a little dried out), creamed spinach and Mac and cheese. All in all, We had a great night celebrating our friends 40th!"
08/18/2018,Spoon,5.0,The food was wonderful. Service was very very good. Atmosphere was excellent.
08/18/2018,johnd,3.0,We've eaten at MJ's many times. Unfortunately this time the food was just average and I didn't feel it was worth the price. Hopefully this is an exception.
08/18/2018,KyleB,5.0,"Our server was so knowledgable and really added to the overall experience.  It was really a joy to hear her talk about the menu, I felt like you needed a college degree in steakology to work as a server here.   It was very expensive but worth every penny, cant wait for another occasion to celebrate here."
08/17/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellent experience. Excellent food. Previously came here about 15 years ago and did not disappoint.
08/17/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The Lamb chops where cooked to perfection as well as the Halibut. We always order the garlic bread with a bleu cheese cream dip. Service was excellent as usual. We will return again soon. Open Table is the way to go.
08/17/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Love Michael Jordan’s! Thank you for bringing back. The bacon Gouda mash trio!
08/16/2018,MichalS,5.0,"A+ service. Second visit there and would not hesitate to go back. Had Brian as a server both times who was the best server I've ever had. Will certainly go back next year for the same occasion. The food is unbelievable. Garlic bread with fondue is the best app I've ever had, steaks are cooked to perfection, bone marrow butter is out of this world and takes your taste buds into another dimension. Suggest you get the mash potato trio on the side of the steak and creme brule or key lime pie for dessert."
08/16/2018,Pia35,5.0,"My husband and I went for dinner for a day night before a show and it was outstanding.  The greeters to the wait staff  was amazing. The customer service was excellent, they checked in with us to make sure everything was going great. We felt really great with our choice. The food was beyond amazing every bite was oh so good. On our way home the next day we had a great conversation about how good the food and service was. On our next trip back to Mohegan Sun we will be back."
08/16/2018,JamesL,5.0,"Best steak dinner I have ever had. The meat was incredible,  the cocktails were spot on. The service was amazing and all of the sides complimented the meal perfectly...well worth every penny."
08/14/2018,IngridNap,5.0,"The service is always top notch.  A perfect evening for a special occasion.Our waitress, Danielle, was attentive but not intrusive.  The food was delicious.  We recommend the garlic bread tower.  You won't be disappointed.  The crab cake is always amazing.  The special won me over with it's petite filet, served over sliced fingerling potatoes, mushrooms and lobster in a wonderful Diane sauce.  My husband's steak was big enough for Fred Flintstone!  Our sides were creamed spinach with an almost gratin topping and creamy mac 'n cheese.  My husband had enough for lunch the next day.  We topped the evening with a special dessert, the bomb, and yes, it was!  A creamy chocolate mousse with a 'kit kat' crust was hidden in a dark chocolate ganache...is your mouth watering?"
08/14/2018,BigAl,5.0,Excellent service  nice touch of flutes of bubbly for our 53rd anniversary Lobster tail was a bit dry but the quality of the beef made up for it.
08/13/2018,MarkS,5.0,My wife and I were celebrating our 35th Anniversary. We thoroughly enjoyed everything from our food to the great staff. We will definitely return in the near future
08/12/2018,Sparklerod,4.0,A little disappointed one half of our porterhouse for 2 was dry. We have never had a problem with the food before. It was a let down as we traveled far just for dinner.
08/11/2018,Pro72,5.0,"First class establishment no matter what your Occasion is. Family, friends or date can't go wrong. Food is always spot on. My experiences with the service has always been great. Highly recommend eating here. Folks at the front of the house great you on arrival and do their best to accommodate your requests. Great Staff."
08/11/2018,terryr,4.0,Everything was very good about the meal with the exception of the salmon. I asked for well done and it was like a hockey puck with no flavor.
08/11/2018,Korn,3.0,"The food we had was very good, bacon app was especially delicious as was the seafood tower. The steaks was very good and cooked the way we asked, but I've had as good a steak from Highland Market and cooked it myself for far less."
08/11/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The prices are somewhat high but well worth it. Not only was the food amazing and cooked perfectly but the service was above and beyond. I had the pork chops and my boyfriend had the MJ del monico steak. We ordered Mac and cheese and asparagus as sides which were big enough to share, I found for the price the sides were a very good size. We of course had to have the 23 layer cake and it was amazing! I would 100% recommend this restaurant if you’re staying at Mohegan, it really started the night off on a high note."
08/11/2018,Maryt,3.0,"My petite filet mignon was very salty upon arrival.  However, the staff did replace it with an unsalted version.  Very accommodating."
08/11/2018,JodyC,5.0,Food was amazing. Highly recommend the bacon as an app. The steak (filet and strip) was cooked perfectly!
08/10/2018,ThomasM,4.0,"The simplest thing was not good , the baked potato was under done . 
The table top needed to be resurfaced . I would expect a restaurant at that price point to be keep up better."
08/09/2018,DavidK,5.0,Great place every time I visit Mohegun sun !!!! The servers are great !!! Especially Robert great server !!!!!!
08/08/2018,LB81,5.0,Wonderful food. Great service. Everyone is always very polite.
08/05/2018,JamesT,5.0,We went for our anniversary and everything was great as usual.  This is our favorite steakhouse by far.
08/05/2018,SteveV,5.0,"We have been to this restaurant several times now.  It never disappoints.  The food is always delicious, and the service is always excellent.  We will definitely be back.  We highly recommend to everyone."
08/05/2018,StevenS,4.0,"My wife and I have made it a tradition to go to MJ's for our anniversary dinner.  We have always had great food, and a great experience.  This time was no different, although we neglected to tell anyone it was our anniversary and the ""above and beyond"" service was not present this year.  Steak specials are always a must, and never disappoint!"
08/04/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Chris K. Took care of us like princes. Our meal came promptly, and was cooked perfectly."
08/04/2018,DavidH,5.0,"Excellent food and service 
They gave my wife nice piece of cake for her birthday"
08/04/2018,jimmyk,5.0,i would go more often if i lived closer the employees are great the service goes above and beyound the food is always cooked perfect.
08/03/2018,John65,4.0,Very good. Will go back again when at Mohegan sun.
08/03/2018,RichardP,2.0,"We enjoyed a booth,  The food is highly priced but not high quality.  Dinner comes with nothing.  They tried to sell us Garlic Bread 2x's before they asked if we wanted dinner rolls.  Lobster was small and the filet minion was badly cooked and not garnished.  Bad presentation with fair food at best for high prices."
07/31/2018,thomasc,4.0,Good food noisy not much privacy
07/31/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great experience. Will go back
07/30/2018,BobbyY,5.0,Excellent steak!! Cooked to perfection and very very tasty. Appetizers and sides were also fantastic. Absolutely worth the price!
07/29/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"My Husband and I have dined here before. We had great steaks, great wine and  great service   We returned this last trip. We took a chance and brought our vegan daughter with us. The chef made a wonderful mixture of really nicely seasoned veggies into a very filling meal for her.  (It tasted better than other restaurants vegan offerings). We appreciated the effort so much. BTW my husband and I had our great steaks and great wine and had a great family meal.  Thank you again for the amazing meal."
07/29/2018,MaryR,5.0,"Our food & drinks were fabulous! Service was outstanding, from our main server (Chris) to the other servers who help.  It was also a nice touch meeting the manager.  Staff is incredibly well trained, from the front desk onward.  Again, the food was exceptional. Thank you!"
07/29/2018,KellyY,5.0,Never disappointed with this place!
07/29/2018,Robertlrice1970,5.0,Excellent food and service. The atmosphere and the food was simply delicious. I would eat there again and recommend it to my family and friends.
07/28/2018,Fran,2.0,"We were at Mohegan Sun for 5 days.  We chose MJ Steak House for our final dinner believing it to be a 'special dinner'.  We were very unhappy with our choice.  We ordered the strip steak.  The middle of the steak was to our liking.   However, the two ends could not be eaten since it consisted of gristle and not meat."
07/28/2018,LindaB,5.0,I did not see one server with an attitude.  The entire staff is extremely pleasant and over-accommodating.  Food was superb!  The only issue - Open Table asks if you want outdoor seating.  There is no outdoor seating at Michael Jordan's in Mohegan Sun.
07/28/2018,ShirleyS,5.0,"Celebrating my daughter's birthday and everything was perfect !!
Especially the Baked ALASKA!!"
07/27/2018,JimK,5.0,Great dining experience. Very friendly and helpful staff. My wife at a pitite Filet mignon she raved about.  I had salmon with clams and tomato jam was delicious. The lobster wontons were also great. Highly recommend Michael Jordan’s our favorite spot when we are at Mohegan Sun.
07/27/2018,MichelleB,5.0,"Overall food was good.  Garlic bread to start was just OK; a little too cooked for our liking.  Had 2 steaks for dinner, both filet, both cooked exceptionally well.  We also both had lobster tails with our meals, and they were cooked perfectly. I don't know if the food above, 2 beers and 2 glasses of proseccos was necessarily worth $200, but we had a good time!"
07/27/2018,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Too dark. Awesome food. Mediocre service.
07/26/2018,Smokeylion,5.0,I have experienced 3 different Michael Jordan Restaurants and Mohegan Sun has the best.
07/24/2018,ColleenK,3.0,"Very Over priced.  Sides were all very unhealthy.  Assuming cost was so high due to being in a casino. If your just getting a steak and salad, it might be wiser. 
Not ideal for families."
07/23/2018,RyanA,5.0,A great dinner. We always love coming to MJ’s to celebrate our special occasions. The staff is always attentive and the food is always perfect!
07/22/2018,ShellyB,5.0,"This restaurant does not disappoint. The lobster stuffed with crab meat was unbelievable. Service was impeccable and the food was amazing. I can say this is my favorite restaurant at the mohegan sun, I've been to other restaurants and I can say its nothing compared to the service and the type of food you get. Really worth the money spent."
07/21/2018,BrittneyM,3.0,Food and staff was excellent but tables were pretty crowded and close together and overall was very loud . For the amount of money it wasn’t the setting I had in mind.
07/21/2018,SusanF,5.0,NEVER disappoints.  It's probably our 10th or so meal there and we never miss going there when we are up in the area !!   The best.
07/21/2018,Gramy,5.0,Whenever we stay at Mohegan sun we eat at Micheal jorden’s. Great food and always friendly personnel service. High end dining but well worth it.
07/21/2018,Foode718,4.0,"We enjoyed our meal , friendly staff, great and attentive wait staff, nice wine list, and creative cocktails, the ambiance was good. Our favorite starter is the The Gorgonzola garlic bread .It is to die for and it was REALLY worth the calories . We really enjoyed our steak also but then who Would not enjoy porterhouse for two cooked to 
perfection .  

Absolutely Delicious 🤤 we will be back again!"
07/19/2018,KatherineM,5.0,"As always, everything was great.  We were seated and greeted.  Our yummy gorgonzola bread came right out.  Love later bisque, filet mignon and great sides.  We'll be back!"
07/19/2018,ClementinaS,5.0,My daughter and I really enjoyed our dinner and looking forward to coming back.
07/19/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"I had a wonderful time at this restaurant. The environment is excellent, food was delicious and the services was great. I really recommend this restaurant."
07/19/2018,SalS,4.0,Brought my girlfriend here for her 25th birthday before heading over to see Charlie Puth at the Mohegan Sun Arena. We had drinks at the bar before dinner and the bartender and drinks were great. Dinner and the service was great. Somehow their was a small fruit fly in her glass of prosecco. The waiter got another one once we showe him. I expected the drink to be comped but it wasn’t. Other than that it was a great experience.
07/19/2018,SamM,5.0,"My server was Chris K, and I had a wonderful meal. I've been to Mjs a lot of times but my experience with Chris was far and wide my best experience there service wise. The food is good, albeit somehow the garlic bread with Gorgonzola fondue sort of dwarfs the rest of the culinary experience there. They should bottle that sauce and sell it. 
I love the steak selection but I would also really like if they could source some wagyu because I would buy it if they sold it. They have wagyu meatballs on the menu I believe but that's not really the same. The presence of a long bone ribeye is also sorely missed especially when they have a 92 dollar porterhouse on the menu. I would gladly pay 100 dollars for the tomahawk chop! 
 The steak tartare was excellent, but I ran out of chips before finishing the meat, and I was really heaping the steak on there, but that's only really a minor critique because it was damn delicious and I put the rest of the steak atop of my garlic fondue bread (slammin) Overall probably the best place to get a real steak dinner unless you want to go to Boston or NYC. The steak in the cities is better but only slightly."
07/18/2018,Jonnycakes,5.0,"Food was great, waiter was great , only bad part was having other tables so close , if the place was crowded then I could see that , but overall was good"
07/18/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great food. Great service. Loved it.
07/17/2018,RobinsonB,5.0,Just a great restaurant that has never disappointed us over several visits.
07/15/2018,NeilB,5.0,The recommended steak was the best steak I’ve ever had.  Cooked perfectly.
07/14/2018,Dependabledave1,5.0,My wife and I use this restaurant for all of our special occasions.  It is always fantastic.
07/14/2018,BinH,2.0,"Host seat lousy table at 5.30 pm with reservation, host and management to be train to be better team."
07/14/2018,food2di4,4.0,"Our server was excellent. Our courses were timed perfectly and we were not rushed at all. We were heading to a concert at Foxwoods after and our server gave us good directions on how to navigate our way there.
Our wine was decanted for us, a nice touch for quality of the wine we chose. Would return again before a show."
07/14/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,BEST MEAL AND SERVICE WE HAVE EVER HAD!
07/13/2018,JaneG,5.0,I have never had less than a stellar experience at Michael Jordan’s Steak House. The staff is professional. The food is exceptional! Would highly recommend.
07/13/2018,AlexO,5.0,This was a guys night.  A few steaks were ordered med rare and they came out well done.   The waitress quickly brought out new ones.   Great service
07/12/2018,RickyC,5.0,Very good food.  Great staff.  They know their stuff.
07/09/2018,KaraZ,5.0,Awesome way to celebrate our anniversary.  We enjoyed the food and the atmosphere tremendously.  We will visit again soon.
07/09/2018,DAVIDF,5.0,"This was our 3rd anniversary dinner, we acutally had our ceremory at the restaurant also.  we come many times during the year, and it is always excellent."
07/08/2018,MarcN,5.0,"As always, Michael Jordan’s serves the best steaks around, accompanied by great service.  Whenever we go t the casino for an event we try and make a visit. But be sure to reserve a table well in advance!"
07/08/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We went early before show.  Service was so attentive and recommendations spot on. Food was great. Was not rushed at all.
07/08/2018,karinm,5.0,"Love Michael Jordan’s!!! The staff and bartenders are the best! Shirley, Eric, CJ, Tim, Jeff!! And of course my favorite runners... Ryan and Justin!! The food is amazing but the staff makes it extra special!!!"
07/07/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Chris K offered amazing service !! His suggestion on the garlic bread appetizer was spot on. We had a wonderful time enjoying the atmosphere and excellent food.
07/07/2018,Guy5702,5.0,"This was our 37th wedding anniversary, and we had a delicious dinner.  Every dish we ate was fabulous.

My only negative was that the restaurant was extremely loud and we had to shout across the table many times."
07/07/2018,PaulT,5.0,Service was awesome and the steaks were outstanding!
07/06/2018,Karl2002,5.0,Everything about our meal was awesome. Only thing I had and issue with is it would seem they don't offer dinner rolls. You would think that when a person is spending good money for a fine dining experience that dinner rolls would be included. Other than that the food was great. We booked on line and let them know it was our wedding anniversary and both the hostess and our server acknowledged it and our server also brought us a complimentary dessert for me and my wife to share. With all that being said we will be back.
07/05/2018,JeanneM,5.0,Excellent steak outstanding crab cake best anywhere!
07/05/2018,Jeff,5.0,Celebrated our anniversary with a nice steak dinner.  Service and food was terrific.  Much appreciated.
07/04/2018,Skama,5.0,Wonderful service. Excellent food. So glad we went there.
07/03/2018,LisaL,2.0,Made our reservation 2 months in advance. The hostesses were arrogant and proceeded to let several parties (who arrived after us) sit before us. Wait staff were understaffed... not as attentive as I would have expected. Food was average.  Left there feeling robbed.
07/03/2018,PatD,5.0,Absolutely mindblowing experience! Phenomenal service. Ordered the 40 oz 28 day dry aged bone in ribeye that was on special. My friend and I shared it and it was far and away the best steak either of us have ever had. The sides were stellar too. We will be back!
07/02/2018,Lec987,5.0,"Wonderful birthday dinner. Started off with the tomato and burrata salad. Then shared the short rib with pasta before splitting a truffle Parmesan crusted filet and side of and asparagus for dinner. Everything was delicious, perfectly season and expertly prepared. Finished the birthday celebration with a piece of 23 layer chocolate cake. Steve paced the meal perfectly and attended to all our needs. Great meal for a  special night"
07/02/2018,baseball,4.0,"We had a problem with one of our two dinners - the Delmonico steak. One was delicious, the other was a much different eat cut of meat. Although the wait staff apologized and brought it to the attention of the manager who stopped by frequently, this steak is why we go there. Another steak was offered, but would have entailed us eating separately so we declined this offer. We were not charged for the one we did order and didn’t eat, but it was an expensive dinner for only one person to truly enjoy. As always, wait staff was exceptional, attentive and went out of their way to make the experience as enjoyable as possible"
07/01/2018,EvaN,5.0,"Food was excellent, portions were great, 4 of us shared two sides and had leftovers. Very attentive service."
07/01/2018,Daffodil,5.0,"Exceptional food. Newly updated menu. The yellow beet salad was light and refreshing. Colossal crab cake was  ALL crab. I took my boyfriend for his birthday, we sat at a booth and I felt like we had the place all to ourselves! Service is top notch, Steve took great care of us. Will return for special occasions often."
06/30/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great food
06/30/2018,CoreyW,3.0,Pricey and portions where on the smaller side but taste was very good
06/29/2018,Eatingout,5.0,2 couples both celebrating June anniversaries.
06/29/2018,LoriK,4.0,"We were celebrating my husband's 50th birthday.  I made the reservation online without a problem.  When we arrive to an almost empty restaurant we were seated at the very last table in the back corner of the restaurant by the exit door.  When I asked for a booth (which almost all were empty), I was told they were not available.  The meal was fine but it would have been a nicer and more pleasant experience with a nicer ambiance other than the exit door."
06/28/2018,SusanS,5.0,Dan our server was very attentive as always. It was very busy and therefore noisier than usual
06/28/2018,BobL,5.0,"Our hostess, Alexus and sever Jessica were off the charts good.To management they r keepers. I had 10 ,000 employees before I retired and they represent ur company well. 
Food was awesome.
Great place"
06/28/2018,Johanna,5.0,Spend our anniversary there and it was amazing! The food the people and the staff was great. Amazing atmosphere
06/28/2018,josephmpalladino,5.0,Had a terrific meal once again able served by Nancy and Ryan.  Lamb chops were outstanding as was the garlic blue cheese bread as a starter.
06/27/2018,ChristineH,5.0,We had three entrees and three sides. All of the food was very good but the salmon could have been a little bit better. I did not expect it to be served in the type of dish it was. On the other hand the other two main entrees were absolutely delicious.
06/26/2018,ShawnM,2.0,"This was the worst experience I ever had. A small wall divided us and 16 young kids that were out of control. Management addressed the issue by offering free dessert.  We dont drink and the meal was $180. Our server was fantastic, the food was decent, the noise level and 16 10 year olds made this an awful birthday dinner for my wife. We were told that we should call first to make sure there are no kid events. Seriously? I dont anticipate dining here again"
06/25/2018,HelenaB,5.0,We really enjoyed our meals here. Steak was cooked perfect. Server was great. Amazing night for our anniversary dinner.
06/24/2018,JohnW,4.0,food was great as well as service . Restaurant was really loud though.

06/23/2018,KR13,5.0,"Always excellent food and service 
Never disappoints. We had the seafood platter - good value for what you got especially coming from nyc. We shared the bone in filet mignon - so delicious. One of the best steaks I have had (better than keens and del friscos in the city). Great service. The noise is a bit much and it’s a little dark."
06/23/2018,EdPes,5.0,The staff were pleasant and the food was very good. Had the Porterhouse for 2 along with lobster tails. Steak was cooked perfect and the lobster tails were delicious.
06/23/2018,LarryI,5.0,Everything about the food and service was phenomenal. There was a group of four men very drunk sitting next to our table and when one of my buddies got up to go have a cigarette one of the other gentleman sat down at our table with a $100 bill asking us if we were gay and on a date because he had a bet going with his buddies that we were. I was extremely irritated by this and after the fact I noticed the other guys at the table were recording the interaction and laughing at their table. Then later in the night the drunk guy that came to our table tried to punch his friends ‘below the belt’ a couple times while they exited the area on their way out of the restaurant after their tab was paid. I love the restaurant and the food and I know this wasn’t something your staff did to make an unpleasant visit to mj’s but definitely made the dinner unusual and aggravating for the he first half of our meal.
06/22/2018,JoAnnM,5.0,Everything was delicious!!
06/22/2018,Kerixon,5.0,A terrific night at this premier steakhouse. Try the 14 oz bone in Filet special or short rib with homemade pasta both are great choices. Lobster is delish if you’re not having the outstanding steak selections. Excellent wine and deserts as we’ll.
06/22/2018,JoeC,5.0,"Been here before so steak is always on my plate, what else. Steak cooked the way I asked to perfection. super wine list and all food side delicious. Staff was kind and courteous. Never have an issue here."

06/21/2018,JamesB,5.0,Great food as always. Service is always great as well. Never disappointed. hard to get a steak any where else after eating here.

06/16/2018,Jcwrestlar,5.0,"The food was delicious. 4 guys ordered 4 steaks and 4 sides. The sides were large enough to share, and many of us got more than one helping of each side. Steaks were cooked perfectly. Tender and juicy.  It’s a little pricey, but we would definitely recommend it for a special occasion."
06/16/2018,Nothappy,5.0,"The Experience was Great. And the food was fantastic!!!
The Best Customer Service I have received in a long Time."
06/16/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,I have always gone to David Burke’s in FOXWOODS. This place has won me over. Everything is better from service to food. I got the 23oz ribeye and it was cooked to a perfect medium. My boyfriends steak was also cooked to a perfect medium rare. Our waitress was friendly and we never felt rushed even when we took our time with dessert and coffee. We will be back
06/15/2018,bunter,5.0,As always outstanding !
06/15/2018,DavidB,2.0,"We have eaten here before with excellent food and service. The recent experience with waiter “Stephen “ was a disaster. He took 40
Minutes to bring our glasses of wine, totally forgot our appetizers and shrugged off the poor service -something totally strange about Stephen behavior!!. Totally unacceptable and a rare event at this restaurant. All the manager did was remove the charge for appetizers."
06/15/2018,GaryB,5.0,Food abd service were excellent.
06/15/2018,RandyS,5.0,"Food, service & atmosphere are excellent! We frequent many steak houses in Manhattan and Long Island. MJ’s is far superior to most."

06/09/2018,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Anniversary dinner. Was given a Happy Anniversary card and complimentary champagne toast. Food was great and the service was awesome.
06/09/2018,GinaK,5.0,Food is amazing but expensive. Good to celebrate a special occasion. Wait staff was outstanding.
06/09/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Tried MJ’s for the first time and loved it! Food and service were both amazing. Highly recommend for a birthday celebration or other special occasion.
06/08/2018,Vkusaila,3.0,Steaks were just all right and not worth the price.  I have had much better steaks at half the price.  Sides were very good.
06/06/2018,MillB,5.0,"I haven’t been to MJ’s in over a year so I was pleasantly surprised when it was even better than I remembered. The service by all was excellent and the food was superb. The steak was cooked to perfection and the sides were diverse and plentiful.
I definitely recommend Michael Jordan’s for a Greta meal and dining experience."
06/05/2018,lovetodine,5.0,Michaels is our favorite restaurant
06/05/2018,TomS,5.0,We ate at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse and had a wonderful time.   The food and the ambiance was excellent.   We would love to eat their again soon.   The service was top notch and the servers were top notch.
06/04/2018,Eddd,5.0,"Management, reception,wait staff and bus / food runners are always terrific.  Amanda the manager always gives it that special -personal - caring touch.  Our waitress on this evening was Jen and she was great.  It was my wife's birthday and the staff made it all that much more of a special occasion.  By the way ---- the food is outstanding and cooked to order!"
06/04/2018,TEDYBARE,3.0,the food was relatively good but very expensive for the quality--the service was very good. the cost of liquor was ridiculous. I would be cautious in going although it was good food.
06/04/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We had the tomahawk ribeye for two, it was amazing!"
06/04/2018,MikeO,5.0,Best steaks I've ever had. Well worth the price. Go back every time I'm in the area.

06/03/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food was absolutely delicious great place to bring your wives
06/02/2018,pacmangolf,5.0,"Had a wonderful experience here tonight before the show in the arena. We were greeted warmly at the hostess station and this friendly atmosphere continued the entire night. By the luck of the draw we got Steve as our server tonight. He guided us through a great experience. He had complete knowledge of the menu and paced our meal perfectly. The kitchen put out a great meal. Started with two of the best salads my wife and have ever had. I went on to enjoy a piping hot bowl of New England clam chowder that was tasty and full of clams and potatoes followed by the best crab cake you will ever put in your mouth, ABSOLUTELY no filler, just crab. My wife enjoyed one of the special for the night, a 7oz fillet served with a poached lobster tail, simply outstanding. As a side we added grilled asparagus served al dented just like we like it. We used Steve’s experience in settling on some called the bomb for desert and we loved it.  Steve made the night for us. He will get us back in the door soon. If you are looking for a special night ask for Steve and let him guide your night you will not be disappointed. Thanks for a great night Steve, already thinking about our next visit."
06/02/2018,Stacey,5.0,Excellent meal!  Steaks cooked to perfection.  Our waiter was wonderful.
06/02/2018,LisaN,4.0,"The porterhouse for two was fabulous!  Service was very good with excellent wine recommendations.  Pricing was as expected for a top-notch steak house.  We were there for a romantic birthday celebration, so the closeness of the tables was a little disappointing, but not terrible.  The waiter brought out a birthday dessert which was a very nice touch.  Unfortunately, the pretty much perfect visit ended with the desserts.  The birthday brownie,although a very nice touch, was very dry.  Having reviewed the menu online prior to our visit, I was very much looking forward to “the bomb.”  Unfortunately, it was just that, a bomb.  The presentation was magnificent, however, with the first taste each of us took, we were extremely disappointed.  It had a very odd taste, which seemed like freezer burn.  Subsequent bites were a little better, but again, the dessert was very dry.  Up until the dessert, everything else was excellent.  Maybe a different dessert choice would have made a difference."
06/01/2018,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Great meal and great service.  Good wine list as well.
06/01/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Always a great experience. Our waiter Dan was the best!
05/30/2018,MargaretL,5.0,The food was amazing and the two servers that we had were very friendly and knowledgeable will definitely be back
05/29/2018,DimarisF,5.0,"It was my Boyfriends first time at MJ’s and he loved it ! It was his birthday and our 1st year  Anniversary together. Had an amazing time and food was amazing as well! They greeted us with champagne that we didn’t even order , cards for the occasions, and a booth with cozy pillows. Food can be a bit on the pricey end, but once in a while won’t hurt. Just advise anyone going to be be prepared for a $200+ meal, but realistically his sneakers are about the same price it’s worth it!  Overall great experience!"
05/28/2018,Romano,5.0,"We dine at MJs steakhouse everytime we are at the casino .The NY strip is incredible and the staff is exceptional.  BEST steak around. We made a long weekend there and dined 3 times. We left and were still thinking about having more crabcakes.lol 
Sooooo delish....."
05/27/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We had a great dining experience, as always, at Michael Jordan’s Steak House. Our food was cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious! We love the garlic bread with blue cheese fondue. Our waitresses were on top of all of our needs. It’s definitely pricey and I feel like the sides could be portioned better for the price but it was well worth the splurge!"
05/27/2018,MyLittleVivi,5.0,"Had a great meal here to celebrate our anniversary.  We frequent many steakhouses in NYC and I have to say this was one of the best meals we've ever had.  Once sat at our table, our hostess gave us a card wishing us a happy anniversary and our waiter came over with two glasses of champagne.  Nice touch.  Definitely set the tone for the meal.  We started with the garlic bread app and the bacon app.  I found the bacon slightly dry but my husband loved it.  I loved the garlic bread.  For mains, I had the bone-in rib eye and my husband had the bone-in Kansas city strip crusted with blue cheese.  Our steaks were both cooked and seasoned to perfection.  For sides we had the mac and cheese and the butternut squash brulee.  If I were to complain about something it would be the butternut squash.  It was ok.  I definitely wouldn't order again.  Mac and cheese was delish!  Our server, Chris K, was phenomenal.  Very attentive, but not annoyingly so.  He was very knowledgeable about the menu and made some recommendations that were great.  Will definitely go back the next time we're at Mohegan."
05/27/2018,Greatwhite,3.0,"We were there Sunday night for a belated birthday party for myself… Our service was overall good, my steak came out a little cold… But I did not bother to send it back because we were starving and we had to leave soon. The martinis were good but a little week… I have had better meals they are in the past!. Probably have been to that restaurant at least 10 times over the past years, most times are pretty good, I would write a restaurant at 3 1/2 stars."
05/27/2018,Elizabeth10112344,5.0,"Great food and friends what more can u ask for our server Danielle was very helpful with the menu no rush juicy steaks

05/27/2018,darrenp,5.0,"Server  and staff was excellent, manager stopped by the table to ask how we were doing.  I’d like to be able to dine here more often."
05/26/2018,Italian,5.0,"The aged Delmonico is simply delicious. In fact, it’s so good that the sauce that comes on the side with it is completely unnecessary. Also, I havent ordered crab cakes anywhere for years....i don’t order them anymore because Im consistently underwhelmed by them. But i took a shot based on the server’s description and I’m glad i did. The crab cake here is very different. It’s how a crab cake should be: nothing but TONS of lump blue crab formed up into a huge tall cylinder with just the slightest thin dusting of breadcrumb crust at the top to give you a little barrier and texture to break through on your way to pure crab meat heaven. The wine list is solid and the service is great.  Will be returning soon..."
05/24/2018,KatieM,5.0,"We came for my boyfriend’s birthday and everyone from the hostess to the food runners made him feel special. We were sat in a cozy velvet booth with pillows and the right amount of privacy. Our waitress Jules was exceptional! She went over the whole menu with us and made recommendations. We took her advice and had the best steak I’ve ever eaten and a blue cheese sauce that had us licking the plate clean! After dinner, Jules brought over a small chocolate cake with a candle and two glasses of champagne. We had a great night out and my boyfriend had a wonderful birthday. We will definitely be back!"

05/21/2018,dhdd,5.0,"Wait staff was exceptional and very attentive. Knew the menu and able to make suggestions and inform us regarding Bourbon and availability. Food was perfect. Had Tuna Tartare for appetizer which was delicious. The garlic bread with blue cheese ""fondue"" was perfect (it will cost extra). Steak was perfectly cooked. Deserts were amazing. The staff was friendly and wished us Happy Anniversary. Only drawback to restaurant is expense. Be prepared to spend a fortune."
05/20/2018,Gonzo,5.0,Had a great meal. Chris K took great care of us and was very knowledgeable. Was the best meal I’ve had in a long time.
05/19/2018,StuartB,4.0,"We go 3-4 times a year.  As always the food was great which is what keeps us coming back.  However, as two people you always get jammed in somewhere which detracts from the experience.  Nevertheless, we'll be back ... because we enjoy the food."
05/19/2018,LennyL,5.0,Awesome dining experience!  My wife and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary and they surprised us with a complimentary glass of champagne.  (Also were given an anniversary card signed by MJ.).  The food was amazing and the service was outstanding.  Would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking to experience a special meal for a special occasion.
05/19/2018,clrohr,4.0,"It was my daughter’s birthday. Even though we had a reservation we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. The seating was awkward because we had a U-shaped booth and it was noisy. This was not conducive to dinner conversation.  Because we had already waited, we were afraid to ask to be moved..we didn’t want to wait longer. We dined at 8pm and we were all very hungry. The steaks were very good . I wouldn’t recommend the Caesar salad . It was wilted and over dressed. The garlic bread appetizer was also very good. 

There was a card waiting for my daughter at the table, signed by Michael Jordan. That was a nice touch and made her night."
05/18/2018,michellem,4.0,"First time trying Michael Jordan's we thought it was very loud and over priced.
I asked for my tuna medium and it came out very well done.
The manager apologized when she saw that you couldn't even eat it.
My boyfriends steak was very good."
05/18/2018,BrendaB,4.0,It was a nice experience at Jordan’s Steak House. Very welcoming. We waited about 5 minutes to be seated. Staff was friendly. Just the service was a long wait.
05/18/2018,JackieT,5.0,"Our dining experience was very good.  Our waitstaff, Julie and Steve were very attentive. Answered all of our  questions and were very friendly.  I brought my boyfriend for his birthday and we had eaten so much , decided not to get dessert but Julie brought over a piece of amazing chocolate cake with strawberry balsamic sauce.  OMG was it good!   We will recommend Michael Jordan’s to our friends and we will be back."
05/17/2018,AnthonyR,4.0,"Overall good. The cucumber martini drink was about the best I have ever had and the garlic bread app was amazing. The lobster dumpling was very good, the filling was excellent but the wonton wrapping was on the chewy side.

The service was 5 stars and the key lime pie was again about as good as I have ever had.

The reason it only gets a good rating in the food section is because of the meat. The KC strip was lousy (way too much charry ashen taste and the meat tough). I sent it back and decided to get the lamb chops....the lamb too was a little too charred but it was overall more tender and could stand up better to the outside being burnt. The chimichuri was borderline orgasmic so that helped too. The lamb was solid but at $52 for 2 fair size lamb chops and there still being a bit of a char issue, I would not order it again. 

When meat is charred and there is an ashen flavor it means carbonization has taken place. I do not know anyone who likes eating charcoal.  The meat at these price points should be perfect meaning it has grill marks and is beautifully carmelized on the outside but before carbonization takes place. This requires deft grill experience which should not be lacking at such an infamous steakhouse. I am not sure I agree with the suggestion of ordering meat there with ""no char"". 

The manager was very gracious and comped two of my martinis and overall it was a decent experience but I don't think I would order a grilled meat there again, especially when I can do it much better at home myself.

I would and will go again for drinks, apps and maybe try a pasta or fish dish."
05/13/2018,SantoB,3.0,"Steak was very fatty, and way to iver cooked... pretty  disappointed."
05/13/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Service & food was excellent
05/13/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"MJ’s is always a great experience.  The food, service, ambiance are first rate."

05/11/2018,brians,5.0,Kevin ...our waitor was superb! He made the meal 5 star with his presence.
05/11/2018,AmyS,3.0,"Ordinarily I love this restaurant, but this past trip was TERRIBLE!!  Ordered my DelMonico rare and usually love it but it was absolutely over cooked, totally burnt on one side.  In their defense I did not complain about the food, but for the price I shouldn’t have to.  When someone hesitates when they ask you how it is or can barely cut through their meat and struggling those are signs the meal is terrible!  I would likely give them another chance."
05/11/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The service was phenomenal!
05/11/2018,HopeG,5.0,"Food was amazing, cant wait to go back.  I will make my husband take me here on the next date night."
05/09/2018,JeffV,5.0,"Excellent service and food was superb. Haddock special was amazing, as was the colossal crab cake and the key lime pie. The food came out much faster than the lunch we had at your Cafe, we had the following day. 
We will be dining with you on our next visit, definitely."
05/06/2018,CesarSalad,4.0,Service is always excellent. One of four did it like their food.
05/06/2018,PeterC,5.0,The food was delicious as usual and our server (I think his name was Stephen) was very attentive and cool. It was a perfect setting for our celebration and we would recommend MJ’s to anyone.
05/05/2018,JosephP,3.0,"The food and service was great. The noise level was way to high, we had to talk extremely loud across the table to be heard."
05/05/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellent food and service; second time there and will definitely be going back!
05/05/2018,CharlesD,5.0,"I had an excellent experience at your restaurant.  Couldn't have been better!

05/04/2018,janm,5.0,"Our steaks were done perfectly and the side dishes were very delicious. Our waiter was very courteous and friendly. The occasion was my wife's 65th birthday. After our entrees were finished, our waiter brought out a small cake with a candle on it. We had a most enjoyable dining experience."
05/03/2018,TraceyD,5.0,"It was our first time dining at the Michael Jordon's Steak House at the Mohegan Sun and would highly recommend this restaurant.   We were celebrating a special birthday for my husband and the service we received was fabulous.  When making the reservation, I had requested a booth if possible which they gladly reserved for us.  After being seated, we were greeted by our waiter who served us complimentary glasses of Champagne for my husband's birthday.    The staff was very friendly and courteous and the food was absolutely wonderful."
05/02/2018,bgrambau,3.0,"Had a business meal on a not too buys Wednesday night.    Service was OK and the food was decent.  Typical high end steakhouse menu, however I’d had better service and food for the same price in a number of other restaurants."
04/28/2018,Bunny,3.0,"All al acart. Way too expensive. Small portions. 
Busy, do you don't need me to return."
04/28/2018,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Food was delicious. We got the 7oz Filet and they were cooked perfectly. We split the 1lb baked potato. It’s gigantic, so definitely shareable.  The Caesar salad was scrumptious. My hubby got the Malbec, which was Devine. I got the MJ Sangria and it was very strong. The waiter was kind enough to take it off the bill. Overall excellent experience. Can’t wait to go back!"
04/28/2018,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Food was very good.  My medium filet was more on well side for my taste.  I did try the house Pinot Grigio and it was terrible and when I asked waiter about it he seemed annoyed. If I’m spending $400 on dinner don’t question a $12 glass of wine. Just give me a new wine.
04/28/2018,ChrisW,5.0,No one in our foursome ordered steak but the chicken and fish entrees were excellent.
04/28/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Food was excellent our waiter was absolutely awesome. No complaints from me.
04/27/2018,JenniferP,4.0,Went there because we were staying over night at Mohegan Sun and wanted to give it a try. Food and service were good it was just nothing out of this world.
04/27/2018,JustineC,5.0,"My husband and I have been coming here a few times a year for many years. The food is unlike anything else- you really “taste” the quality of the food. But this time our waiter was more educated than others. All the times we had been here and I never knew I could do half an appetizer.? Thank you Chris K. And when we asked if the margaritas could be made a little “lighter” he had a solution to that as well. Very accommodating! Also the manager Jimmy who usually is always there when we dine ensuring the quality of our experience was on his game as always. This is a staple dining place for my husband and I. Thank you for never disappointing and actually getting better each time. Shout out Chris K again. MVW- most valuable waiter.

04/23/2018,Eddd,5.0,"The staff, service and food ----- always terrific, always!"
04/22/2018,PoolGuy,2.0,Good as usual other the the epic failure of management to control an obnoxious table in dining room. We all may get loud sometimes but the failure to control the vulgarity is not acceptable. Free appetizer does not compensate for the ability to control guests and inability to adhere to the restaurants policies
04/21/2018,Tammy,5.0,Thank you for making our special day even better! Our server Max was wonderful and the food was phenomenal!
04/21/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We always make it a point

04/21/2018,KylieR,5.0,Brought my sister for her 30th birthday weekend. The food was incredible as well as the atmosphere. The staff was very friendly and brought out a special dessert for her birthday. My husband and sister said it was the best steak they ever had. I opted for the scallops which were incredible as well.
04/20/2018,Hockeyfoodie,4.0,Food was very good.  Service was good.  Nothing over the top like you would expect for the price

04/16/2018,WilliamP,5.0,"Everything was great, this was my second time dining at MJs.   One suggestion would be to make the burgers available next door an option for kids but I understand, it’s a steakhouse."

04/15/2018,Anar,5.0,"I understand why I have to make reservations as early as possible, this steakhouse redefines fine dining and sets a new standard for the most sought-after dinner experience.
Saying that I would recommend this place to all my friends & family would be an understatement. Visiting Michael Jordan’s steakhouse @Mohegan Sun should be on everyone’s bucket list."
04/15/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Where you can go for great food. Not big portions but the food will melt in your mouth.
04/14/2018,UnaS,5.0,Amazing... We were seated at our Reservation time. The Birthday boy was presented with a birthday card signed by Michael Jordan. Dinner was delicious. One of the best steaks I’ve had. It melted in your mouth. Then chocolate cake was brought out with a candle in it. We were very thankful  that Happy birthday wasn’t sung. Sometimes that’s all you hear when you go out to dinner. It made for a much more enjoyable dinning environment. Can’t wait to go back again. Thank you for making a great 50th birthday celebration
04/14/2018,Credcove1,5.0,"Worth every penny. Absolutely delicious. I am very picky with shrimp cocktail. I like it large, firm and cold.  This shrimp cocktail did not disappoint. Meatball appetizer was also delish.  Pork  chops were out of this world. Cooked to perfection. Tender and juicy. Filet with mornay sauce also cooked to perfection. Very tasty and sooo tender. King crab legs were mouth watering good. Tender sweet With a yummy butter sauce. Brussel sprouts are to be had by all. Best ever. We were so happy with everything. The service was outstanding. We ordered drinks and they came within minutes. Ordered apps which came out within five minutes. And then our dinner. It was not rushed. Cocktails also lovely. Can’t say enough about this place. It is worth every cent spent."
04/14/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The servers and food was very good. It was a little loud in there but we got seated at a nice booth which help with the noise. Will go back again someday.
04/14/2018,HollyS,5.0,"The steaks were awesome! I had the ribeye and my husband had the strip, both were moist, delicious, and cooked to perfection (we like our steaks medium). The trio was also delicious. We unfortunately couldn't eat it all so we took our leftovers home. My husband had my steak the next day and said it was still delicious. Although pricey, it is worth the money. Our waitress was excellent!"
04/14/2018,Lori,5.0,"Great meal, even better staff! Must go! You have to try the garlic bread and any steak. The mashed potato trio is also fantastic!"
04/14/2018,Maureen,5.0,"My husband and I had a great dinner out at MJs.  Our server Steve was new to the staff, but excellent.  Jimmy the manager was doing a great job helping us arrange a future business dinner I needed to plan,  and Ryan was absolutely fantastic bringing us our food and making sure everything was spot on! Ryan also recommended some great suggestions for our next visit.
We had the special,  which was a filet, scallops,  and lobster tail.  They cook the lobster in champagne and butter,  omg!  I also added a truffle parmesan crust to my filet, my husband had his oscar'd... Awesome food,  awesome service, we had a great evening... thank you!"

04/08/2018,Mairsey,5.0,"Food was what you expect from a steak house, potatoes were cold in their side dish.  Service good, not great or over the top."
04/07/2018,Humgirl,4.0,My husband and I had dinner to celebrate our anniversary. The service was great. We had the bacon appetizer and garlic bread with cheese which are a favorite of ours. They were as delicious as we remember them being on previous occasions. Caesar salad was superb. The server even offered anchovies which we love. My husbands steak was so tender. I enjoyed the lobster cavatelli dish. Our only disappointment was the chocolate cake was too dry.
04/07/2018,Paul,5.0,The only thing I can complain about is that I ate to much to enjoy a dessert which I'm sure would have been as fabulous as the whole meal! My wife and I had not been out in sometime and on short notice I was able to make a reservation and so worth the money to spend with my wife!
04/07/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We had a nice meal without wait.
04/07/2018,Glutenfreegirl,4.0,"For a pricey steakhouse..service was average at best...hostess was dressed too casual   They are the face of the establishment...

Presentation of the prepared meals lacked creativity"
04/07/2018,ABRLMT,5.0,"Nice, very expensive
Good and drinks good"
04/07/2018,SarahS,3.0,My husband and I got seafood dishes.  They were delicious but not worth the price. We also got the app recommended by the waitress- garlic bread fondue.  It wasn't anthing to rave about. I wouldn't get it again.
04/07/2018,JayF,5.0,Our server Robert was fantastic and would return on his service alone!

04/06/2018,JenNJ,5.0,I had the NY strip. Best piece of steak I've ever had... Albeit also the most expensive. I have celiac and they were great about accommodating gluten free needs. Service was superb.
04/06/2018,JCola,5.0,"MJ's consistently delivers a fabulous meal.  The lump crab-cake app is amazing, consisting almost entirely of lump crab meat w/out all the bread crumb.  Perfectly cooked & seasoned.  Worth EVERY penny!!  As was the garlic bread gorgonzola app - heaven on a plate.  Our filets were delicious & prepared flawlessly.  The service was outstanding, thanks to our server Chris K.  A repeat diner of MJ's - I always look forward to another fantastic meal there!"
04/06/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We shared a few things- oysters which were excellent,  small & tasty. The crab cake,  so yummy & not filled with stuffing,  mostly all crab meat! We also had a filet, which was cooked perfectly, creamed spinach- YUMMM & an amazing bottle of wine. Everything was so good! This was our 5th time and it did not disappoint! We'll be back!"
04/06/2018,JoseT,5.0,Great Kansas City strip and bone marrow butter. As always great food great service.
04/04/2018,Pugs,5.0,"Everything was exceptional!  We went to celebrate my 65th birthday and retirement.

I was given a birthday card diner NY Michael Jordan when we arrived and led to a cozy booth.  Robert, our waiter, was super.  We did not order drinks, but he brought us 2 glasses of complimentary champagne.  We ordered the seafood tower which was delicious.  I then had filet mignon topped with crabmeat and my partner had salmon.  I should add the warm rolls were phenomenal as was the entire dinner.

Robert brought a complimentary brownie with candle.  It was a perfect dinner!"
04/04/2018,JohnH,5.0,Love when we go MJ's. Always a great steak and the service is too notch
04/02/2018,Christian,5.0,"We went to Michael Jordan’s at Mohegun Sun, our steaks were excellent, in fact my wife said it was the best steak she has ever had! A little noisy, but overall a great dinner. It’s on the pricey side, two for dinner with tip $240. I had a few beers and wife had one mixed drink. I had the ribeye, she had the New York strip, I would recommend the NYS strip. Our server Chris was great!!"
04/01/2018,Retired,4.0,"It was Easter and I think the regular staff was not on board. Service was good but our waiter was a bit hesitant on certain food items.  However he was very willing to accommodate us and I really could not fault him. 
The meal (Tuna) was cooked well but lacked any seasoning even salt. The rice with it was also bland. Maybe the kitchen staff was not the regular staff also because the food has always been seasoned to perfection with an interesting display of some type of rice. Thank you."
03/31/2018,Keith,4.0,Food was worth the expensive price once again the service is average not a professional staff at all.
03/30/2018,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Steak was delicious and the side of corn was excellent.  However, the Mac & cheese side was one of the worst I’ve ever tried.  Not sure if it was supposed to taste like that, but the Mac & cheese was horribly bland.  The restaurant was also very loud and hard to hear my date.  I won’t be back - there are much better steakhouses out there for the money."
03/29/2018,HGC24,3.0,I was craving a great steak and this just didn't measure up. We had a $57 rib eye and it was just fair. The garlic bread with the dipping sauce was good and that is all we had.
03/27/2018,SusanS,5.0,"Once again our dining at Michael Jordan’s was excellent. Dan, our server, was attentive to our needs."
03/25/2018,WarrenW,4.0,It was our first time visiting. We were celebrating our 20th Anniversary and was surprised when the the manager gave us 2 compliment glasses of champagne and an Anniversary card. It was a nice touch. Thank you. We will be back.
03/25/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Restaurant is well appointed. Portions are a good size and the food itself is very good. Well made cocktails. Service also solid. All in all a very good experience. I would go back again.
03/25/2018,Jmarsh,4.0,"The food is wonderful and the service was good. The only thing that I find somewhat annoying is that even with a reservation, the hostess asks you to “stand over there “ and wait. Sometimes you have to wait for a longish time. The standing room is literally right smack in the middle of everything. Its very chaotic.  Other than that, I love MJ’s!"
03/24/2018,MikeT,5.0,Love it!  One of my favorite places to eat!  Great food great service!

03/23/2018,Hav2eat,5.0,Awesome!  Great service and spectacular food as always
03/21/2018,Cat2Lan,5.0,We celebrated a  birthday on March 21.  The service was excellent. The bartender and our waitress Jules were gracious. One of best martinis I've had (at bar) and love the martini glass used.  Jules was enthusiastic and gave great recommendations. Our Bordeaux by the glass was superb.  Only choice we did not care for was the cheese bread app. Think this needs to be recreated. Ciabatta seemed too heavy for the light cheese sauce.  Thank you for a lovely experience.
03/21/2018,GrantH,5.0,Had King Crab Leg app and Seared Tuna w/ Roasted Mushroom side. Quality was impeccable and service was as excellent as one would expect. Great meal.
03/18/2018,Suelea,5.0,"The Menu was fantastic- so many great choices. Try the blue cheese fondue garlic bread. I had the Delmonico steak and it was ""out of this world"". Our Server- Steve and his assistant were so attentive and made great recommnedations"
03/18/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Excellent steaks. Corn off the cobb is always a favorite. Martinis were perfect, and served in elegant stemware. A great meal"
03/17/2018,PaulE,3.0,"Got the Kansas City Bone in for $52.  Flavor was OK, but steak was very tough.   Service no problem.   Value not the quality of high end steal restaurants in Boston or New York with similar pricing.   Won't rush back."

03/07/2018,KenB,4.0,Another wonderful dinner at this great steakhouse at the Mohegan Sun Casino. The service and wine were fine. But the meat (I had the 10oz filet mignon and my friend had the 8oz strip steak and 3 shrimp special) was spectacular...very flavorful and exceedingly tender. And the butternut squash side is good enough to be a dessert. A definite stop whenever I come back!!!
03/07/2018,NancyP,5.0,"Impeccable service, outstanding steak, crab cake, and everything else.  Lives up to the phrase, ""you get what you pay for""."
03/04/2018,Freddy,5.0,"Greatest as ever,had a great time and meal and services."
03/04/2018,Maiko2,1.0,"I always enjoy Micheal Jordan. I don't if they just change the chef but the food was not what I usually expect. This experience did kind ruin any good comment I had for you. It was like being at a bruin game loud . I felt the waiter was cocky. The food portion were on the smaller side . They mess up and gave horseradish mash potato which was horrible, the corn felt like it was soaked in lemon juice amd the steak wasn't as special and good like it use too.
I'm overly disappointed with this experience."
03/04/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Everything was great, and I want to thank our Waiter Chris K for all he recommendations and excellent service."
03/04/2018,Laura6196,5.0,The wait staff and food were incredible - truly a great night!
03/03/2018,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"So we had Chris K as a server. He was very positive and knowledgeable about the menu.  The problem is that he tried to upsell us on everything. It gets tiring after a while. All of his favorite items were the most expensive items on the menu. I am ok with McDonald’s asking me if I want a large, but I don’t need a waiter continuously asking me if I want to add a bunch of items on to my meal. It gets old fast. He also highlighted the fact that we should go on to Open Table to give him a review because he gets something out of it. He also pointed out that we should ensure that we point out that Chris K waited on us, because there were multiple Chris’ at the restaurant. Well, here you go Chris K, I will ensure everyone knows you were responsible for a less than impressive dining experience."
03/03/2018,TomE,5.0,Food is always good here.  Never a bad meal. Excellent service.
03/03/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Staff was wonderful and food was delicious! One thing was tables were very close together and you can overhear everyone’s conversations.
03/02/2018,Barbie,5.0,"Food, drinks and wine were superb. Service was outstanding. Would go back anytime!"
02/28/2018,SusanS,5.0,Once again we had a wonderful time. Chris K was our server and met all our needs. We will look forward to returning again soon.
02/27/2018,John,5.0,Everything was perfect. Good drinks and service.
02/27/2018,tinaob,5.0,"The hostess was very nice and patient with us as we switched or tables a few times, sorry I didn't get her name.  Chris K was our waiter and we found him very knowledgeable about the menu and gave us great recommendations. He also spaced the courses out properly as we didn't want to be rushed. Food is always great here but this time the service from hostess to busboys made it a great dining experience! I will be back and request chris k!"
02/26/2018,Solid,4.0,"Birthday celebration!  We were very happy with the overall experience. Our server, Julie, went above and beyond to make sure all of our needs were met. Thank you!"
02/26/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Great Atmosphere, service and Food."
02/25/2018,MartyAttorney,5.0,Amazing food and great service.
02/25/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,2 birthdays
02/24/2018,Overpriced,4.0,"The food and service was well above par. The price is a bit high, even for such a good meal. Everything is a la carte, which is why the price per item is a bit much. Would only plan in eating there once a year, or on a special occasion."
02/23/2018,CherylL,5.0,"Absolutely loved this restaurant! Our first time, and will definitely go back. Pricey, but everything including drinks was perfect. We had a nice private area with a bench against wall with pillows. The manager pulled our table to let us in, then pushed it back so we were nice and cozy in sort of a private booth. My only complaint is with Open Table. We never got a confirmation for our reservations made over a month before, so when we arrived at casino hotel, we were trying to contact open table to no avail because technical problems on site, and restaurant didn’t open until 4pm and it was around 2pm. Met some friends who got through to the sports cafe, and were told they were not accepting walk ins. Finally reached someone at 4pm, who sent me a confirmation of our reservation. I would prefer an advanced text to remind and confirm reservation in future from either restaurant and/Open Table."
02/23/2018,Pete,5.0,Everything was great. The server (Chris K.) was awesome. Can’t wait to go back.
02/22/2018,SHNYC,4.0,"Was excited to try this steak house but was disappointed. 
Filet Mignon was very dry and tiny - overcooked and overpriced, bread and salads were good, mashed potatoes and salmon were great. Service was good but very mechanical and pushy. 
There are much better steak houses if you are in the mood for a good juicy steak."
02/22/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Best steak I’ve ever had.  I got the filet mignon with bearnaise sauce, so tender!  We got 4 sides to share amongst 4 people and it was plenty of food.   Asparagus, mashed potato trio, truffle fries, and macaroni and cheese.  No room for dessert, which was kind of sad because the desserts looked amazing.   The cocktails were great.  I had a signature cocktail with bourbon and blackberries.  Next time, I’d get dessert to go. Highly recommend this restaurant!"
02/22/2018,EdAa,5.0,"Dinner for 2 on a Thursday. Reservation at 5:15pm and the place was mostly empty. Filled up by 6:15.  Several servers took care of us and were very attentive. Shrimp & ahi tuna apps were good. I had the filet, it was amazingly tender and delicious. My wife had the scallops which were good too. Better without the fig topping though. Salads were good. I would go back again."
02/21/2018,Cesca919,4.0,Food was delicious. A tad overpriced but good.
02/21/2018,HamparK,5.0,"Overall it is a ten. We ate early, 5pm, so it was quite but by 7pm it was full and loud. The bone in steak was superb!  Best steak and ive been to very high end places. Fillet -not so fresh or tender but I do believe this was a one off so I hope I discourage anyone but I will leave my review exactly how my experience was. They offered to remake it but we choose not to. The manager, Jim was excellent and the whole night was making sure all the tables were happy and even refunded the fillet which I thought was very nice of him since we didn't even ask for a refund. Sides were a little different  but very good so go ahead and try it! Large wine, beer, cocktail selection too. Bit pricey but I definitely suggest you try it at least once and definitely order a steak. Steaks are huge in size and in my opinion, worth the price."
02/20/2018,ChristineA,3.0,Had 7pm reservation for a booth but wasn't Sat until 730. I brought it to the managers attention that we had to wait 30mins at bar but she only said sorry they have limited booths- she could of at least compt the one drink each we had while waiting -
02/20/2018,nami,5.0,"Birthday dinner
I love my filet medium rare. 
My wife loves the crab cakes 
Trio potatoes are always a treat too"
02/19/2018,GinaC,5.0,"Amazing!! Always love going here to eat, relax and enjoy!!"
02/19/2018,LisaP,5.0,"Amazing service. Waiter was friendly and well informed (gave us more information than what was on menu so we were able to avoid a food allergen). Well worth the drive and the prices. Food (apps, dinner, sides, desert) and drinks were outstanding!"
02/18/2018,Snop48,5.0,Great food and great service.  everything was cooked to perfection.
02/18/2018,AaronZ,5.0,Best steak I have ever had. The sides and apps were incredible.
02/18/2018,Bartzt,5.0,"We thought everything was absolutely delicious. We had the bone marrow, blue cheese sauce and bread and crab for appetizers. For dinner we shared a rib eye, mashed potato trio and Mac and cheese. All we perfectly made and even better than we expected."
02/18/2018,km23,4.0,Great as always but not as good as last time..steak a little overdone
02/18/2018,KathyH,5.0,"We have been numerous times and have never had a bad meal.  I highly recommend the garlic bread and bacon to start.  The corn and mash potatoes are phenomenal.  
The staff is always fantastic."
02/18/2018,JustineD,5.0,I was disappointed that my older sister could not attend the dinner after we traveled over an hour together to dine at the steakhouse. When I made the reservations it did not state that you had to have ID to enter and it just so happened that she lost her ID a week before my birthday so that was very disappointing but otherwise the food was great. Sorry she had to miss it.
02/17/2018,MichaelL,5.0,food was amazing.. the staff really knows the food and treat u like royalty..if u eat at a good steak house u know u are gonna pay for it but every meal i have there is worth every penny..also we haven't been there in a year and we recognized that most of the staff was the same ! we were there 2 hours and never rushed! make ur appointments early!
02/17/2018,JustineC,5.0,Always amazing here. Our guests were late and they still seated us allowing us to have a few drinks while we waited. They did mess up our reservation though. The front hostess didn’t get my name right or the number of guests in my party right. When my guests showed up and gave my name they said that I hadn’t showed up. They had to call me and I had to guide them to our table. No bueno. But the food and atmosphere is to die for. Will be back.
02/16/2018,SoniaH,5.0,We had a wonderful night! Great food as always! Looking forward to our next visit
02/16/2018,ScottM,5.0,Food and service were outstanding
02/16/2018,Good,3.0,"Seated promptly, oysters from Massachusetts were so small they looked painted on the shell and not particularly tasty,  truffle fries with aioli out of this world!  Steak cooked to perfection.  Caesar salad was enough for two people, could have been a little tastier.  
Complaint:  LOUDNESS.  For an upscale restaurant, the noise level should not have been so high.  It really ruined the evening.  Spoke to manager who was sympathetic but did not really do anything.  Problems:  Bar area and high tops are too close to diners.  Put a partition.  Open kitchen is passé, no need...more clinking dishes, hence more noise.  Large (and usually loud) parties at big tables should be put together in the back of the restaurant so 2 and 3 people can dine in peace.  Not sure if I would come here again.  I've been several times, but I think this is my last."
02/15/2018,MaureenT,5.0,It was absolutely delicious would recommend to everyone I know going there!!!
02/15/2018,JazmineM,5.0,Chris K. was an awesome server! Would go back just to have him again! I had a horrible experience with a server right before getting there so it’s was nice to have someone who knew what he was doing.
02/15/2018,DonnaG,5.0,"Amazing food, awesome waitstaff."
02/15/2018,MacS,5.0,Excellent food and service.
02/14/2018,AnnM,5.0,We LOVE Michael Jordan's Steakhouse. We're always impressed with the quality of the food and outstanding service we get every time we go. Thank you for a great experience!
02/14/2018,AnthomyC,5.0,Service excellent. Food delicious with beautiful presentation. Recommendations from waiter were perfect. Would definitely dine there again.
02/14/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Amazing food and service. Great price for a special dinner for two. We will be back again for the roasted garlic and porterhouse for 2 it was amazing.
02/13/2018,Clocker,5.0,My wife and I enjoyed our recent dining experience at Michael Jordan's. The service was friendly and attentive to our needs. The martinis were perfectly prepared and our steaks were delicious and cooked just as we had ordered them. We shared a Caesar salad and au gratin potatoes but we were much too full to have dessert. We really like this restaurant and will return whenever we visit Mohegan Sun.
02/13/2018,Eddd,5.0,"Always excellent food !   The staff from the GM, Manager, Hostess, wait staff, food runners etc.---- all just terrific.  This has become one of my favorites and should be yours too!"
02/12/2018,Cindy,5.0,We went for my birthday. Excellent service and loved the crab cake
02/11/2018,MeMc,5.0,The food is absolutely delicious and the  service is impeccable. Definitely worth the little splurge.
02/10/2018,TerryB,5.0,"Our Server Chris K. was excellent, very attentive, and very entertaining.  Great recommendations on the menu."
02/10/2018,SusanZ,3.0,"The food was delicious though the meal took a very long time.  Even without ordering a starter or salad, it was still a solid 1 hour 55 minute meal-we barely made it to the concert on time."
02/10/2018,GlennB,3.0,"The quality of the food has changed, sinc the last time we ate there."
02/10/2018,Kimc,5.0,Excellent service and food! Everything was fabulous! Best steaks around!
02/09/2018,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Service was amazing!!! Food was Delicious.  I wish they provided nutritional information though.
02/09/2018,TomM,5.0,Great would do it again
02/09/2018,MJBerry,5.0,"We have dined at MJ Steakhouse many times and it never disappoints.  The steaks are amazing and always cooked perfectly as ordered.  They also have the best crab cakes anywhere.  Since we had someone who had never eaten here before, we ordered the garlic bread with blue cheese fondue as an appetizer.  It is absolutely delicious, but usually too filling for just two.  The service is always attentive without being intrusive."
02/09/2018,DavidB,5.0,Very comfortable for a quiet dinner.  Crabcake was as good as the waiter intimated.  Delmonico and Filet steaks were   amazingly tasty.
02/07/2018,ElizabethM,5.0,Not many vegetarian options was hopping there would be more.
02/07/2018,SusanS,5.0,"Once again our experience was wonderful. Amanda, the manager, always visits our table to assure that we are pleased with service and food. Dan our server was attentive as always. We look forward to returning later in the month."
02/06/2018,SandraJ,4.0,"We went during the week, early evening. It was very quiet. The food was great. I have food allergies and had no issues.  It's a great place for intamate or large gatherings."
02/04/2018,PeterD,5.0,Great Food and and Service.  Would definitely go back!
02/04/2018,Dnewmason,3.0,Very nice atmosphere. Value of entrees was good. Ordered several sides and they mostly missed the mark in terms of quality and value
02/03/2018,bouley,1.0,"We were celebrating my sister's birthday on this past weekend at the MJ, we had order the ""signature dishes"" crab cake, Alaskan crab legs and the porterhouse steak for two.
 the crab meat wasn't  fresh, it was still mushy in the middle , the Alaskan crab legs were too salty, and the dish of the steak wasn't warm and the steak was and meat is cold.  I had been to this restaurant for many time and I don't understand the food was executed so badly.
I hope the chef/manger should pay more attention to the food  quality, I personally will not come to this restaurant for a very long time!"
02/03/2018,Lanl,4.0,"If you are looking for stunning food this is probably not the best choice. Food tastes just above avg. Environment, location, and services are good."
02/03/2018,Doel,2.0,Nahhhh it's nothing to write home about.. and way too expensive
02/02/2018,GerardB,5.0,"This restaurant never fails to impress me. As a steakhouse, its steaks live up to the reputation. But they also do seafood well. Crabcake app is amazing! And their sides are dishes in their own right, not just an afterthought."
02/02/2018,Eddie,5.0,I Always dine at  Mj when visiting Mohegan sun. Steaks are one of the best I’ve  ever had.  Overall great restaurant!!
02/01/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,While the food and service was excellent the lighting was very poor I had to use my camera light for my husband to read and I did see others tables doing the same thing. The noise level was to much for us too . I should have researched more I do realize this is a sports bar/ Rest.
01/28/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We had mentioned when making the reservation that it was our anniversary so we were surprised with some extras. Our servers were amazing, as was our porterhouse for two. Perfectly medium rare, saved with house steak sauce, and Bearnaise. Our sides were the trio of mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese. We got the garlic bread appetizer, with blue cheese fondue poured tableside. Lastly, we got the baked Alaska for dessert. I'm not big on sweets but I loved this. Overall, this was one of the best meals weve had in a long time. Great for a super special occasion."
01/27/2018,Stephanie,4.0,The 32 oz porterhouse steak for two was delicious. Cocktails were wonderful. We will definitely be back next time we visit Mohegan Sun.
01/27/2018,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"The oysters were fresh and clean, salads were well made and tasty. I ordered a rare Kansas City strip, it came to me extra rare/bleu to almost raw. Wouldn’t have been a big deal but the server went missing for 25 minutes before I tracked her down to tell her. 
A replacement was offered but the sides were cold and we weren’t going to wait another 20 min to get a steak when there were things to do. Manager wiped the raw steak off the bill, big deal."
01/26/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,My wife and I were at Mohegan for a show and so glad we choose Michael Jordan’s for dinner.  Our waiter Mike was fantastic.  Our steaks we cooked perfectly and were delicious.  We will definitely come again.
01/26/2018,ReinaC,5.0,"The food was GREAT. Our waiter, Chris K. was very friendly and very helpful and polite. Everything was perfect."
01/25/2018,TammyL,4.0,"Our waiter Chris K was great! Our steak was not cooked properly, we were served another one. A free dessert would have been nice. Beautiful big booths"
01/25/2018,tuscanyfan,5.0,"The food was perfect as always. My wife had the shrimp which were full And delicious. My filet was cooked exactly as I like it. 
Chris K., our waiter was very pleasant and attentive. 

Remains our favorite restaurant."
01/22/2018,SusanS,5.0,Once again MJ’s made the evening special as we celebrated our friends 57th Anniversary. Ryan our server was attentive to our needs and the hostess was also very attentive.
01/22/2018,JoAnnW,5.0,"We can not say enough nice things about our experience at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse. The food was phenomenal and the drinks wonderful but the most outstanding aspect of our experience was the service. Michael Jordan's staff was so very welcoming, helpful, kind and fun. We felt valued. We will return again and again."
01/22/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Meals were outstanding!
01/21/2018,Leona,4.0,The food was phenomenal and service was great! Prices are high but it's nice to be able to have food options like this in the area. Highly recommend for special occasions.
01/21/2018,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"I had a resv for 8:30 for my husband's  50th bday - we did not get seated until 9:30.   The meal was great but restaurant was freezing and after asking to have the cold air not blowing 2x's,  it never happened.  I would recommend but it wasn't the experience I was hoping for."
01/20/2018,Jr12218,5.0,The best steakhouse in the state and the drinks are perfect. All four had different dinners that were outstanding.
01/20/2018,JerryR,5.0,When you spend $50 for a steak - you expect it to be good and ours were GREAT!!  All the sides were very good too.  The staff was very professional and attentive.  Will go back.
01/20/2018,Anon13,3.0,The service was excellent but the filet mignon with garlic butter tasted like vinegar. It took away from the flavor of the steak. Management replaced the steak but at that point we were already full so I am not sure how the second one came out. Must have been something sour in the butter.
01/20/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Loved it my lady friend was very Impressed the food was great the service was great the atmosphere was great thank you so much I had a wonderful time and it was very impressive
01/20/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Delicious but Please bring back bacon Gouda mashed potatoes!!
01/20/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Anniversary dinner. This place never disappoints. Love, love, love it!"
01/20/2018,SSGG,3.0,"Burratta was very good. My steak was cooked just right. My wife had scallops although they loved led good, they were cold. Nothing worse than cold food. 

Birthday dinner was a letdown but will go back since I am a soar member at Mohegan and visit at least 4-5 times per month"
01/19/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Michael Jordan's supplies a nice combination of quality food and quality atmosphere. The food is absolutely delicious and the setting is a quiet intimate surround that appeals to all who just want to have a nice relaxing evening. For those who want to ""up the excitement"", there is a fun bar next door that is attached to the Michael Jordan's brand as well. Good for all people and ages."
01/19/2018,BrownSugar,5.0,Consistently awesome from all angles. The only thing missing was MJ himself!!

01/14/2018,LeeRoi,4.0,The bone-in tenderloin is our favorite and we get it every time!  The food is fantastic and service is excellent! We are never disappointed.
01/14/2018,FairfieldLawyer22,4.0,"We enjoyed our dinner and the service was excellent.  Our steaks were perfectly cooked and they were delicious.  Certain aspects of the meal were in need of improvement, however.  Notable was the creamed spinach which had an overabundance of bread crumbs and a strange flavor that was not welcome.  The desserts were also big on presentation but not so much on taste.  We had the cheesecake and Boston cream pie.  Each was just so so.  Overall, this was a worthwhile trip and a beautiful environment, but there is better food at Mohegan than this."
01/14/2018,SusanO,5.0,"Great experience from the hostess station to the servers, to the bus person Knowledgeable and friendly! Great food it was a happy Birthday for sure"
01/13/2018,SemperFi,5.0,"MJ's is the finest restaurant at Mohegan Sun among all of the the top restaurants located there.
The way staff is exceptionally knowledgeable and very professional in performing their serving responsibilities! The managers all make  a point to stop at the table and recognize our dining experience.
The small touches such as splitting an appetizer or entree for us 'seniors' that are not quite able to ear as much as we did in years past is very much appreciated!"
01/13/2018,StaceyN,5.0,"Everything from the service to the food was excellent.  It's very loud though.  I may request a booth next time,  the noise level might be better.  Will return."
01/13/2018,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Birthday dinner!!!
01/13/2018,Localeater,3.0,"This was the second time here.  While our server was attentive and the atmosphere stunning, we were disappointed this time w our meals. The first time we came it was worth every penny, and we were blown away.  This time the food was lackluster, underseasoned, and Luke warm. The delmonico steak, a $58 cut of meat ( with no sides... everything is al la carte) was very grissly, over cooked, and not very sastiating. Dinner for two including drinks, appetizer, meals, and sides set us back over $300.  While I'm willing to pay good money for a good meal I was very disappointed and am unlikely to return as this meal was not anything special."
01/13/2018,frederickw,5.0,This is the third or fourth time we have eaten at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse.  The steaks are out of this world and the staff are friendly and helpful.
01/13/2018,JeffreyF,5.0,"Outstanding experience thanks to Michael the waiter, the bus staff and Jimmy the Manager.
The food was delicious and cooked to perfection. It was an excellent choice for my wife's 50th birthday. I highly recommend it and can't wait to go back."

01/12/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Did not disappoint- food was amazing & the service was excellent.
01/11/2018,LizaF,5.0,"My husband and I went for dinner to celebrate our anniversary. The service was great! We both enjoyed our dinner, it was amazing! 
The only downfall ( which isn’t even that bad and wouldn’t stop us from going back) was that it was a bit noisy were we were sitting. 
There were a lot of people in the bar area and the noise just carried.
I would highly recommend this restaurant for a fabulous tastebud experience!"
01/11/2018,ALANL,5.0,Shirley at the bar is the best!!!!
01/07/2018,NYFoodie,1.0,"Disappointed with MJ’s choice of seating personel.  Young lady-(white blouse, short hair) in charge of greeting customers failed to notice our reservation request for a booth at 810 as we arrived for our 815 appointment. We were directed to an ordinary table, but I said didn’t you  see our request for booth? She became annoyed and said it would take “an hour” for a booth, we said “OK” and went to sit by the bar, as she became visibly annoyed, shaking her head. We waited for 35 mins, as we witnessed 2 other parties being sat down at a booth, all the while being told twice by girl in black(with a tablet), and very classy Asian gentleman, that our table was “being set up”. We were hung out to dry by this pissant, but was seated hurriedly as soon as female restaurant manager arrived to supervise."
01/07/2018,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Little bit pricey for what was good food, but average service."
01/03/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We went to this restaurant to celebrate my father’s birthday. It was a fantastic experience! The food was so good and presented so well! The 23 layer chocolate cake was to die for!!!
The service was great as well. Everyone that came to our table was kind and polite, as well as very helpful in making decisions."
01/02/2018,EdmundS,5.0,"Was a great time, food and service was excellent . I would highly recommend."
01/02/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"My family goes there quite often especially for special occasions. Salad had been forgotten, however was quickly replaced. The bread is not as soft and warm as they had them before. However, steaks were extremely well cooked. The tuna tartare and oysters from the raw bar were very fresh and juicy. Highly recommend!"
01/01/2018,OpenTable Diner,5.0,the big reason was because we had Dan for a waiter and he was the BEST
01/01/2018,Gramy,5.0,We had a wonderful experience New Year’s Eve at Micheal Jordan’s steak house. The service was impeccable. Our waitress was Jennifer and she did an amazing job. Her suggestions were right on point. She also had a super friendly personality. We would definitely ask for her on our next visit. And yes the food was amazing.
12/31/2017,PSEReview,5.0,Best food ever! Steak cooked perfectly (med rare) & melted in your mouth! I have eaten in many fine dining restaurants & Michael Jordan’s is TOP NOTCH. You will not regret making a reservation here!

12/31/2017,Byron,1.0,"Took my wife for her birthday... we were very excited to try out place but left very disappointed. . Food came out wrong not once but twice. If I'm spending $70 per steak I would expect it to be cooked the way I ordered. Sent back first time, within 3 minutes we both had new steaks on table but were cooked wrong again (definitely a rush job)... sent everything back , payed tab and went home hungry... HAPPY BIRTHDAY HUN!!! 😠😠😠😠"
12/31/2017,LarryV,5.0,"My wife and I had the Porterhouse for two it was cooked to perfection.  We came in after a show at the Arena.  We had a great time, food was excellent and the experience very pleasant.  I would recommend."
12/31/2017,Astoria718gal,4.0,"Lobster dumplings & King Crab Legs - excellent! 
FYI - you can get a half order of the garlic cheese bread. 
If they have the filet mignon with the bone - get it. Amazing. The bone adds great flavor to an already perfect cut of tender meat.  
Bone-in ribeye was ok kinda boring had to add a lot of salt, maybe get one of the crusts/sauces 
Excellent wine by the glass selection - ie. Cake Bread mmmm... 
Chris K was excellent, attentive & informative as were the rest of the staff there"
12/31/2017,Marty,2.0,"Steak was inedible . I am used to the fine New York steakhouses such as Peter Lugars and Bryant and Cooper.

Not planning to return.....ever!"
12/31/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We requested a corner/wall table for reduced noise (my husband is hard of hearing) we were given a wonderful table at the back of the restaurant- was Perfect! Food was all amazing! We love Mohegan Sun & now MJ’s will be part of future visits! Thanks for a Great dinner and memorable evening ! Happy New Year!
12/31/2017,Dwayne,5.0,"Can’t say anything wrong about this restaurant. Great staff, food was absolutely amazing, 5 stars."
12/30/2017,JenniferG,5.0,One of our all-time favorite restaurants and an absolute “must” when at the casino
12/30/2017,Dave,3.0,"We were at Mohegan Sun for a show and took in an early dinner at MJs prior.  Seating was a few mins behind the reservation, but no issue at all especially considering the crowd on New Year's weekend.  The wait staff was excellent and friendly and all courses came out timely.  

The only area that leads me to a good versus great rating was the quality of the main dishes.  I had a NY Strip that was good, but not comparable to those enjoyed in other CT steakhouses such as Blackstones, Joseph's or David Burke's at Foxwoods, my personal favorite.  My wife had the scallops and she enjoyed them.

If you are at the casino and looking for a good dinner, MJs will be a good choice, but for the cost don't expect the best steak experience you have ever had.  Summary, good not great."
12/30/2017,Paul,2.0,"Waitress was very nice along with the manager. I got the filet and asked for medium well, but both times came back well done.  They were very understanding but for the price you expect it to be right the first time considering the restaurant wasn’t busy yet. The quality control needs to be better prior to food being served."
12/30/2017,StevenL,5.0,"Great ambiance, amazing food, perfect for a romantic evening!  I'll definitely go back again!!!"
12/30/2017,DeborahD,4.0,"We were here to celebrate a special birthday with some wonderful food and MJ's did not disappoint. I highly recommend the bone-in rib eye with Parmesan crust. Delish! The Lobster mashed potatoes were scrumptious as well. We are looking forward to another visit.
Deborah"
12/30/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The only reason fir the 4 stars is that 2 of us arrived and were seated (we were a party of 4).  No one came to take a drink order until the other 2 members of our party arrived, about 10 mins.  If you’re going to seat me, please come see if I’d like a drink while I wait fir the rest of my party!  Other than that everything was great!"
12/29/2017,Paris0908,5.0,"We both ordered steaks which were perfectly cooked....I had the petite filet mignon with smoked blue cheese crust, which was tender and delicious. We also had the garlic bread with cheese fondue — very tasty. Of course this is an expensive place to dine, but our meals were great and we’ll come back again next year."
12/29/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food was amazing. The service was excellent. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed out meal and the experience. The only thing that could be improved is the look of the restaurant  on the inside.
12/28/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Great steak dinner as always.  Love the garlic bread and maple smoked bacon apps.  Our server Chris K was very informative and quick with everything we asked for.  Place knows how to do it right!
12/28/2017,DiningL,5.0,Michael Jordan Steakhouse has friendly servers in a classy atmosphere with the best cuts of steaks and delicious mashed potatoes.   We have enjoyed every one of our experiences at the Mohegan Sun location.
12/28/2017,SS12,5.0,"Food and service could not have been better!
Really terrific experience all around."
12/28/2017,Greatwhite,3.0,"Have been here many times...this day was not good!! The service was fair, due to shortage of staff...waiter was good thought....my food came out cold, and cooked incorrectly and and had to be sent back....everyone was done eating by the time my stea k& potatoes came back. I expected better from a high class restaurant....the manager was very nice and comped my steak....but still was not a good experience! What are you willing to do for a customer who eats out a lot and frequents the Casino."
12/27/2017,KarenM,5.0,What can I say. Great food and service. You pay for it though but it’s worth it. Will definitely be going again.
12/27/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,One of the best steaks I’ve ever had - a special bone-in filet with bacon and cheese crust. Outstanding.
12/27/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The steak was delicious, as was all the food! Atmosphere was great, service was great. Highly recommend and will be coming back!"
12/25/2017,KeysChic,5.0,We have enjoyed so many fabulous dinners here. Jules and Ryan are just two of the staff who make our evening so much more enjoyable. The atmosphere is perfect and the food is consistently delicious. You can't go wrong with the filet mignon and the garlic bread is a must!!!
12/24/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Went to Meghan sun MJ awesome steak,service and the pumpkin pie martini was amazing.."
12/23/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Went on the Saturday afternoon before Christmas. We were expecting it to be busy, as to the stated online unavailabilty of a table after 4:30. We were one of two couples there at that time. Business did pick up after 5:30, but the dining area itself was still barely 3/4 full.
Our waitstaff did a flawless job. My wife and I shared the Porterhouse for two.  It was excellent, rivaling  that of Von Lugar's in Scranton, PA. 
I would highly recommend Michael Jordan's if you wanted to have a really good steak, done right. My wife and I plan to go back again."
12/22/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Make sure to ask for no char on your steak.  The servers and management were on spot.  The little things were all met and exceeded, but our steak was burnt beyond belief.  Char is great for bbq brisket and street tacos, but the blackened nightmare ruined our medium rare steak dinner.  Loving the rest of the food though and the manager made sure we left happy.  He was super nice.  We would definitely come back for the appetizers and dessert, yum!  Omg the chocolate cake was one of the most amazing looking work of arts that i have ever eaten.  I have had a lot of fancy deserts before and this one topped them all. I have  a photo of it but cant seem to upload it."
12/22/2017,km23,4.0,"My only complaint would be the server. He seemed to look down on me for whatever reason. Possibly because i was a party of one or because i am young, he assumed a smaller tip and hence gave lesser service. He treated me differently then the other guests. Little does he know i am a large tipper and normally tip 50% of my bill, which in this case the bill was just over 100 so he lost out on a large tip due to his attitude and poor service i only tipped 25%. Food was outstanding however and would return again for the food."
12/21/2017,paulieboy,2.0,"Ordered Porterhouse for two.  Meat was tough, grisly and surprisingly small.  Sides were lukewarm and one was not the side we ordered.  After a couple attempts to chew the meat, I told our waiter.  We began again.  This time we ordered a small filet and a ribeye, and different sides.  This time the meat came out hot.  The filet was good but had little flavor and was undercooked.  The ribeye was tough.  The baked potato was warm not hot.  The creamed spinach was hot but the top hadn’t been browned and the portion size was quite small.  Service and manager visit was nothing special.  No offers or “comps” for the poor experience on this birthday celebration."
12/21/2017,Uscnkwm62,2.0,We ordered a Del Monica steak and it came grisly and underdone.  Finished with this place.  This is the second time we have been very dissatisfied
12/20/2017,KenB,4.0,"My wife and I had a fabulous dinner at Michael Jordan’s Steakhouse at the Mohegan Sun. Alhough the service was slow and my Malbec was disappointing, the food was outrageously good. Both the 7 oz and 10 oz filet mignons were spectacularly tender and flavorful. And the butter squash side was good enough to be a dessert. We highly recommend this restaurant if you want excellent (and memorable) steak and sides."
12/19/2017,SusanS,5.0,Once again our time at Michael Jordan’s was fantastic. Food outstanding as usual and Chris K did his usual job of taking good care of our needs. See you next month
12/17/2017,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"This was our second visit to Michael Jordan's Steakhouse.  We arrived about 30 minutes before our reservation time and were immediately sat.  After ordering and receiving our first round of drinks, no one checked on us for a significant amount of time and we had to call someone over for bread and drink refills.  The food took a very long time to come out and no one came over to tell us it would be a while.  The food was great when it did arrive.  When asked by the manager how our experience was, we were honest and although we didn't want compensation, they comped two drinks.  Overall, we were there from about 8:40 PM-10:30 PM; no apps or dessert, only entrees."
12/17/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Food was amazing
12/16/2017,robertg,5.0,I took my fiancé here for our anniversary and everything was awesome they gave us a card and champagne...our waiter Chris K was awesome very nice and took care of us and made yesterday a very special night ...the food was awesome and I couldn’t be any more happier with how last night when
12/16/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,An amazing restaurant! Between the service and the food you can't beat it. I judge all other steak houses based upon Michael Jordan's.
12/14/2017,DebMassachusetts2013,5.0,"We went for my birthday dinner. Both my grown children recommended MJ's. because of their own experience. MJ's did not disappoint. Our server, John was great and attentive without being overbearing. We both ordered the wedge salad for our appetizers. They were very good. Then we ordered the bone-in rib eye on John's recommendation. He thought the rib eye had more flavor than the Delmonico cut. We ordered it medium and it came out perfect. It was so tender,juicy,and loaded with flavor. We had the side of 3 mashed potatoes. It came with regular mashed with butter,horseradish mashed and my favorite, lobster mashed. There was literally lobster meat with every bite. Then, we finished our meal with the 27 layer chocolate cake because we were celebrating my birthday.(Good excuse,right?) Surprisingly, it was delicious and very moist. We had a 1/2 bottle of Melbac which was very good. The whole bill including a 20%+ tip was under $200.00. I would give our overall experience a  10+.  If your in the Mogehan Casino area you definitely need to stop in. You will be pleasantly surprised with the whole dining experience."
12/14/2017,MichaelN,5.0,Beautiful restaurant with great food and excellent service
12/12/2017,Carolmic,4.0,Went to dinner here this past Monday evening with my husband for our wedding anniversary.  They gave us a free glass of champagne to start us off.  I had the bone marrow as an app and my husband had the crab cakes.  He made the better choice.  We both had a version of surf and turf that they more or less let us customize.  The steaks were very good and cooked well though we both thought the turf was underwhelming.  The complimentary rolls were delicious.  For the price we paid we expected just a bit more.
12/10/2017,CTDinerPW,5.0,Went to MJs to celebrate my birthday before a show at the casino. FANTASTIC from start to finish. Treated like we were their only customers. Friendly staff and delicious food. Not our first time here and certainly NOT our last! Thank you MJs.
12/10/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"I was there  Sunday evening 4:45 reservation.
Our waitress was great.  Couldn’t do enough for us.  
For one of our sides we ordered creamed spinach but a waiter brought out asparagus.  When we told him we ordered the spinach he immediately went back to the kitchen and returned with the correct vegetable. Upon reviewing my dinner receipt the next day I noticed I was charged for the asparagus which was $3.00 more than the spinach.  I’m sure it was just an oversight but I don’t like to pay for something I didn’t have."
12/10/2017,TinaM,5.0,"My husband and I had a delicious dinner before attending a concert. At no point did we feel we were rushed, our waiters were professional, engaging and helpful.  The food was outstanding. I would recommend d this to all my friends."
12/09/2017,mmpjsd,2.0,"Our food and service was outstanding. However the experience fell apart when a ""manager"" came to our table and begged us to move to another table because he needed ours. We counted 12 empty tables near us. We had only been in our table for 1 hour and 10 minutes and we explained that we were leaving very shortly when we finished our last sips of wine because we were headed to a concert in Mohegan Sun. He continued to insist that we move, so much so, that we finally had to ask him to go away from our table. After a great meal food wise and an excellent waitress (Jess) and a $700+ check, the night was ruined by this ""manager"". I would not recommend this restaurant just for the fear that this might happen to you."
12/09/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Don't skimp on the all carte sides, mash potatoes out of this world and if you are a mushroom lover like I am they are a must."
12/09/2017,anthony,3.0,My steak was over cooked.  Shame on the chef!  My server offered to put a new one on the grill but I did not want to be wasteful.  The thought of throwing steak away was bothersome to me.  The server gave me a free dessert.  I waited 10 years to go to MJ and I was disappointed.  There is no excuse for a chef at a steak house to overcome a piece of meat!
12/05/2017,Eddd,5.0,"Food, staff, management and atmosphere all terrific."
12/05/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We came for our 44 year anniversary dinner and we were not disappointed. The food was mouth watering and the best steaks we had in a long time. Danielle was the perfect server, she was very helpful, pleasant and courteous. She made our special night most enjoyable.  We hope we can make it back for our 45th dinner!!!  Thank you all."
12/04/2017,AWilliams,5.0,Absolutely incredible food with fantastic service. Always a pleasure to dine here.
12/03/2017,HeidiH,4.0,Overall it was a nice experience. Food was pricey but excellent. My only issue is that we were there for our wedding anniversary  and when booking we did check the anniversary box as our  reason for the reservation. Not one person acknowledged it in any way. Not even to say happy anniversary. Last time we dined there for our anniversary they made it feel special.
12/03/2017,okrus08,3.0,"Not a good steakhouse, maybe because it"
12/03/2017,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Service was excellent. Most if of the food was very good except the $57  Ribeye... Lots of Gristle..size and taste good..overall a disappointment !
12/03/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Amazing service and food was phenomenal.
12/02/2017,LocalFoodie,5.0,Food was amazing!!
12/02/2017,CTFoodie,1.0,"Very rude hostesses took forever to greet us (joking around with each other) then tried to seat us next to server station/kitchen door even though we made reservations months ago and there were plenty of other empty tables - and then were quite rude about moving us. Crabcake smelled fishy, tuna tartare was splattered all over the plate, and then both the filet and the ribeye,  ordered medium rare and medium respectively, were pretty gray all the way through). We didn't make a big stink about it because it was a birthday dinner - and we had theater tickets and didn't want to prolong the meal by sending everything back. Our waiter was super friendly and attentive - really did his best  - but he couldn't make up for all of the other problems. If you have occasion to dine at Mohegan Sun - save your money and go elsewhere."
12/02/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Service was excellent and the food while pricey was excellent!!! Ps - the crab cake is every bit as amazing as they claim it is!!! We did the porterhouse for two and it was amazing!!!

OUR WAITER WAS WONDERFUL!"
11/26/2017,TRdiningout,5.0,We always enjoy dinner at this very nice restaurant! Food and service are great. We get to enjoy a wonderful dinner before a show. We always choose Michael Jordan's~
11/26/2017,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"I thought the noise was to loud 
The food was quick coming out of the kitchen
The waiter was very friendly"
11/26/2017,CPEve,4.0,"Overall, a very nice place for a 'pre-show' dinner.  We had a booth and the atmosphere was quiet and relaxed, which was very much to our liking.  The food was excellent, as was the service.  Pricing was on the steep side as everything was ala-carte and added up quickly."
11/26/2017,NjeriB,5.0,"A very nice experience! Took my boyfriend out for his birthday and he really enjoyed his filet mignon, the desserts and the overall look and feel of the restaurant. Our water was extremely attentive, they even brought out a lit candle, which I didn't ask for but greatly appreciated. Worth the visit. Its a bit pricey but was a nice experience overall."
11/25/2017,StephanieN,4.0,Server was excellent
11/24/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Chris K. Was a fantastic server. He was so personable and friendly. He made sure that my steak was completely to my liking (I’m pregnant so he also made sure that my steak was well done enough to be safe without being over cooked. He was a great waiter.
11/23/2017,roberts,5.0,Our waitress Sheena was superb all the food was timed perfectly and cooked to perfection probably the best dinner I've had there yet!  That is my go to restaurant when I'm at Mohegan sun
11/23/2017,DiningL,5.0,Our waiter Chris K was great and the steaks and service are always delicious.   Mashed potatoes are superior.  Great special occasion destination.
11/23/2017,majorettefoodie,4.0,I had the bone in rib eye that was to so tasty!  I would highly recommend it. The service was excellent and the ambiance was quite enjoyable as well.
11/22/2017,OpenTable Diner,2.0,We come once a month and the service this time around was horrible.  They didn’t refill our waters multiple times even after we asked.  And they weren’t attentive to us at all
11/21/2017,DrPhilS,5.0,"The manager Paul and Amanda are always pleasant, wonderful, welcoming and generous.  We are always meant to feel important and make it a point to stop by our table or warmly greet us whenever we dine.  Each of the hostess and/or waiters are also warm and welcoming and make us feel as if we are be waited on in our own dining room.  This is the ONLY spot we frequent when at MS and because of these special folks, is the main reason we eat at this establishment.  The food's ""A"" quality is secondary."
11/20/2017,Clocker,5.0,"My wife and I enjoyed our recent dining experience at Michael Jordan's at Mohegan Sun. We have dined tbere many times previously, and we have never been disappointed. The service was friendly and attentive, and our martinis were perfectly prepared. We shared the crabcake appetizer that was delicious. We also shared the porterhouse for two that was cooked perfectly and that we could not finish, but we enjoyed the leftover steak the following day. We were too full to order dessert. It was an outstanding meal, and we will definitely return to MJ's for dinner whenever we're at Mohegan Sun."
11/19/2017,Birthday,1.0,The food tasted amazing the place was nice but I got so sick shortly after leaving.  I had to miss a day of work because of their food. Never again!
11/19/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Amazing food
11/18/2017,Nichan,5.0,"By far one of the best restaurants that we have ever had the pleasure to dine in. We were promptly seated for our reservation and greeted by Jessica our waitress . We explained it was our first time there and she did a wonderful job running through the nightly menu and specials. We decided on the porterhouse for two and the mashed potato trio. The steak was by far the best I have had, it was cooked perfectly and omg what a flavor. We both enjoyed the potato selection. Kudos to Jessica, if we had the chance to dine out each night, she would be our choice, on point the whole night not just with our table but also her other tables. As a matter of fact the whole staff was on point"
11/18/2017,Yuma123,4.0,Dinner was phenomenal at this location. Service was prompt. For appetizers we had the garlic bread
11/18/2017,Blklab,5.0,Yummy .. always a  happy meal.. pricy but  worth it..
11/14/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,If you’re going to eat calories this is the place! NE chowder is outstanding - salmon oh! La! La! Steak? To die for - baked Alaska  - satisfies the sweet tooth! And they make a cosmopolitan as it should be! Enjoy the moment as it is worth the bill you’ll Be paying!
11/14/2017,OpenTable Diner,2.0,Food definitely not on par with what one would expect for the prices charged.
11/14/2017,SusanS,5.0,Once again our evening was fantastic!  Chris K made our birthday celebration a wonderful experience.

11/12/2017,RichardA,5.0,"I set the reservation through OpenTable and noted that we were going there for an anniversary dinner. We were given a very cozy booth, an anniversary card was on the table and our waiter  (who was outstanding) brought us complimentary champagne.
I ordered on of the evening's specials which consisted of a filet mignon, lobster tail and scallops.  Everything was cooked perfectly and was one of the better dinners I've had in a long time.
I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a high end dinner."
11/12/2017,82much,5.0,"Great meal and service to celebrate my friend's birthday.  We shared a salad and a main course (good thing, it was way too much food for any one person!), and had a wonderful dessert.

11/10/2017,AnneR,5.0,The best seared scallops tender fillet and perfect lobster tail
11/10/2017,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Well, steak was good, my filet didn’t look like it was 10 oz, nor it was center cut high-rise, but it was rare+ (as I ordered it) so I didn’t feel like to complain. French fries tasted burnt and looked burnt. Service was good & attentive, best part of the evening redeeming the restaurant. 
This place needs table cloths, it would make it much better."
11/10/2017,Kitkat,5.0,My second time here. I come down to Mohegan Sun just for MJ. Love the food. Porter house for 2 is my fav...And the mac and cheese is wonderful.  Recommend this place for all you steak lovers. Will not be disappointed.
11/10/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Chris K was a great server - took care of us and got us out in time to see our show! Steaks were delicious.
11/09/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Love this place, love the garlic bread"
11/07/2017,GaryW,5.0,Delicious food excellent service. The manager Joe goes out of his way to speak to every customer.  We sat in the bar by the kitchen. We were so impressed by the professional staff but more over the food runner who makes sure every dish goes out hot.  He should be appreciated for his hard work and professionalism.  We didn’t ask his name but the one server said he has been there 15yrs
11/05/2017,CesarSalad,5.0,Wonderful service. Always fun and pleasant. Good food.
11/05/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Everything was perfect as always. Jimmy the manager was very attentive and made us feel very welcome. The filet is to die for!

11/03/2017,ReginaA,5.0,"We visit CT for a family gathering annually and a staple is the Michael Jordan restaurant. Sometimes we are too early and go to 23 for lunch which is great but for this visit we were celebrating two birthdays and had reservations for a party of six, which was my mistake. I did not count our hosts that we were staying with. I called the restaurant the day prior and they graciously moved our reservation by 30 minutes and accommodated us. 

The ambiance was perfect, food was stellar, the first time visitors in our group were amazed and are still raving about the cocktails, appetizers, steaks, sides and desserts. I believe that I have picked up some additional travelers for my routine trip. Thank you for your stellar service!"
11/03/2017,PaulC,5.0,Staff was professional courteous and very helpful with menu choices.  Food was prepared perfect. Lobster mashed potatoes were fabulous!!. Steaks were great! All in all a great dining experience. Worth the money.
11/01/2017,elainem,5.0,"My husband and I make an annual trip to mohegansun every year. Michael Jordan steakhouse is a huge part of the weekend. It’s always been outstanding. However, it is now simply amazing. The crabcakes are second to none. The porterhouse for two was sublime. Never disappointed at Michael Jordan steakhouse. However, this time was exceptional.  Special thanks to Chef  Cliff. He took the time to speak with us at the end of the evening."
10/31/2017,KimberlyM,5.0,"Our waiter Chris K. made the dinner even better.  He was so knowledgeable about all the wines.
My friend and I had a lot of questions on the menu and Chris was so nice and accommodating.
We ended up with apps, dinner, add-on's. dessert.  I was in food heaven.  Chris came over just enough times to ask how everything was, he didn't hover.  We were never flagging him down, it was such a great dining experience.  Plates were taken away at just the right time, your check came quickly.  The food was just amazing.."
10/29/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Food and service was excellent. Would definately come back.

10/29/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,I am from New York and have been to all of the great New York steakhouses. The Delmonico steak that we had at Michael Jordan's was the most  flavorful ribeye that I have ever eaten. Absolutely fantastic!!!
10/29/2017,KCJH,5.0,The food was excellent and the service was great. The bone in Filet mignon was amazing. Chris K was fantastic
10/28/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Everything was great. Thanks for taking care of the birthday cake. Just a little annoyed to have to wait for our table when I made a reservation. We would come back the food was amazing.
10/28/2017,CindyL25,4.0,"Michael Jordan Steakhouse is my go to restaurant at Mohegan Sun.  I have been to all the Gourmet Restaurants on Property and without a doubt Jordans is my favorite.   The food is consistently great and service is usually top notch.  It is on the pricey side but given the quality of food , It is worth the dining experience."
10/28/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,just outstanding experience and fine dining. The restaurant was clean and all staff were dressed  properly  for the atmosphere
10/28/2017,Pickyeaters2,5.0,This is one of the best steak houses ever     I have eaten here about six times and have never been disappointed      Top notch all around
10/28/2017,JoeH,5.0,Always a great meal here.  I e been many times.  Never disappointed.  Baked Alaska is awesome
10/27/2017,DMS37,5.0,"The food was fantastic. Steaks, scallops, sides and salad were all delicious. We will definitely be back. The best restaurant at Mohegan Sun!!"
10/27/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Good food and service. Casual feel to the atmosphere but expected more. The menu is overpriced considering the level of service and ambiance. For these prices I would expect a white tablecloth and better service. Not that the service was bad, it was just OK.

Overall, if you don't mind the high price, it was a good meal."
10/26/2017,MICHAEL,5.0,Outstanding from start to finish - the garlic bread is life changing.
10/24/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"One of my favorite restaurants, love the garlic bread !!"
10/22/2017,AlyssaD,5.0,"It was great! We mentioned we had a birthday and if they had a booth available and we got seated exactly where we wanted. It was very nice, from the attentive wait staff to the mouth watering food."
10/22/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Couldn't ask for a better table,my fiance and I was seated at the last table in there it was the perfect table for 2 no one had to say excuse me a bunch of times it was her an I enjoying a fine dinner. Our waitress was helpful her name was Holly she even gave my fiance a hi-five for finishing her drink which she complained about at first..the meal was great just a lil pricey."
10/21/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,It was a pleasure dining there. We enjoyed celebrating our anniversary.

10/21/2017,DanDon,5.0,"Steaks were great ny strip was excellent,Delmonico was also great. Every one very friendly. We will be back."
10/21/2017,ARSNV2015,5.0,This restaurant never disappoints! The food and service is always top notch. We recommend making reservations as the location is always busy. The wagyu meatballs are a must try!!
10/21/2017,Sotomayor,5.0,"Exceptional service. The Food Was Outstanding!
I will never be satisfied with another steak unless it’s from here. Wish there were MJs near the Hartford area."
10/20/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food and service were both amazing.  It was my first time there and I will find another reason to go back.
10/20/2017,Angela,3.0,"I was excited to bring my boyfriend here for his birthday. The service was great, our servers were great, the hostesses were very nice. However, the food lacked quality and did not match up to the amount of money spent. We were both really disappointed with our entrees and my boyfriend would eat anything. :("
10/20/2017,DavidG,4.0,Decent food but somewhat overpriced even for a steakhouse. Good atmosphere.
10/19/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Never had a bad meal or experience! Great for any occasion or even a date night!!!
10/17/2017,yummy,5.0,"Great wine selection , great food ,garlic bread is so good ."
10/14/2017,Kathy,4.0,Good service.  Staff was pleasant and upbeat.  Steak was tender and tasty.  Creamed spinach could have been hotter.  Crab cake was very good.  Bacon appetizer very good.  Large portions for the sides.  Enough for two to share.  Be prepared for a good sized bill as everything is a la carte and pricey.
10/14/2017,Steaklover4life6579,5.0,"My girlfriend and I, each order a steak from menu after a delicious appetizer we had shared. We ordered 2 different cut of meat, both cooked to perfection !!!! Are side were also very tasty"
10/13/2017,NickP,5.0,Epic meal .. despite an ordering hiccup .. Kansas City strip was one of the best I have ever had .. every morsel of food was delicious and cooked perfectly .. my guests and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.. Will definitely be back
10/13/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"As before this restaurant always rises to the occasion, this being our anniversary. We did not know that they knew it was our anniversary, so when the Champagne arrived it was unexpected but very appreciated.

Service was outstanding and the food was great. A new burgundy on the list from Domaine Gille, and somewhat new to the USA. A great wine for the price - a 2012 - great fruit and a reasonable price."
10/13/2017,MichaelF,5.0,Have dined at Michael Jordan's in the past and always enjoyed the experience. Certainly recommend to anyone looking for a special restaurant to dine out for an evening.
10/12/2017,FrankG,5.0,Very friendly service and great food. I being able to watch the people walk . I have recommended this place to my friends
10/10/2017,lucial,1.0,"The bar staff was unattentive.  Seems the quality of the creamed spinach and garlic bread has changed.  The filet minion was cooked to perfection, however the butter (sauce) on top stayed solid.  Beaurnaise sauce. (??)"
10/10/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Surprisingly good all around.  I say that because if I went according to Yelp, I wouldn't have dined here.  Anyway, excellent service, delicious, perfectly prepared petite filet, lobster tail (succulent),  mashed potato trio very good.  The mushroom side was a bit too heavy-handed, could've been less drenched in wine sauce, also better more exotic mushrooms would have been welcome.  This is trivial overall as the dinner was excellent overall.  Service could not have been more attentive.  Recommended."
10/09/2017,Crazy4fishing,3.0,"We have eaten here before and had a wonderful experience.  This time, they missed the mark.  First, they didn’t have the wine we selected from their list.  Second, after specifically asking for my wife’s steak to be cooked to a certain level of doness, it came out wrong.  As a result, we could not eat at the same time.  Third, the creamed spinach was tepid, not much flavor, over cheesed.   To be fair, the manager came over and comped the steak, but we weren’t there to get a free steak.  It was our anniversary and the issues took away from the evening.  All in all, it felt like they were just “mailing it in” for the night and it didn’t feel special.  We were underwhelmed."
10/09/2017,FredA,5.0,Great food. Would love some smaller entre portions on steaks and desserts so we could try a greater variety of items.
10/08/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Everyone was so great there !!!!
10/08/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Husband got special which was boneless ribeye with grilled shrimp.  I got petite filet.  Both cooked as ordered and really melt in your mouth delicious.  We split a chopped salad...it was split in the kitchen and we were each served an ample portion and it was delicious.  Sides ordered were grilled asparagus (ordinary) and mashed potato trio (outstanding).  Sorry we didn’t order the garlic bread with blue cheese.  Next time we will!  Service was perfect....just the right amount of attention without being overbearing.
10/08/2017,FoodWanderer,4.0,"We had a really great experience here, first time. Food was excellent, service was amazing. Only down side was that it was slightly too dark, couldn't really see because we were tucked behind a wall that blocked the dim lighting. It was a Saturday night at the casino and it was just way too loud but they don't have control over that. The noise from the bar would carry over and in turn the dining area would increase in volume. I would go back but it's not a romantic, quiet dining experience."
10/07/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The service and food were very good.  It was an enjoyable dinner.  However, for a high end dining location the noise level was very high.  This is a pricier restaurant.  Overall it was a good dining experience."
10/06/2017,DrPhil,5.0,Excellent steaks and wonderful oysters with great service by our waiter Chris
10/06/2017,Skiman,5.0,"Great steaks and chops, the garlic bread with blue cheese fondue is out of this world! Pricey but worth it!"
10/05/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,This was my first time dining at Michael Jordans and it did not disappoint.   The king crab leg appetizer was amazing.   The steak was one of the best I've had.  I would also recommend the trio of mashed potatoes.  Just enough food to fill you up but not over stuff.. (and some leftovers to take home!).  I would recommend MJ's to anyone from couples looking for a energetic date night to a small group looking for a great meal.   They had a great wine list and cocktail menu.  Just overall a great experience!
10/03/2017,RufusVS,5.0,"This was the second time I have taken my wife here for our anniversary.    It is very pricy, but it doesn't prevent the place from being packed during dinner hour.  It's in a casino, so there are plenty of deep pockets that appreciate a good meal.  That's the problem.  You'll spend at least 3x as much on the meal here, but it will all be perfect.  You leave thinking ""God, that was a lot of money"", but you'll say it without regret. This last time we had a combination platter, which actually was just a ($80 each) ""suggestion"" of the ala carte items (lobster tail, filet mignon, and sauteed scallops).  We started with their garlic bread tower ($11 I think). Cocktails, wine, etc. with a decent tip was over $300 for the two of us.  But we'll go back again, I have no doubt."
10/03/2017,RichardG,5.0,Excellent wine list. Many choices besides steak on the menu. Appetizers and accompanying dishes were superb.  Lobster mashed potatoes were to die for as was the creamed spinach. Desert is a must. We shared baked Alaska and creme brûlée.
10/01/2017,GilbertoS,5.0,29th year anniversary
10/01/2017,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"We made a reservation  and as we were sitting there a giant fly kept landing on our plates, appetizer and right in the water my boyfriend was drinking. It took us almost 45-50 to get our food and it was just ok. I have had a better meal before and was very disappointed."
09/30/2017,RENEES,5.0,"Took my mom her for her 80th Birthday. Great food, Atmosphere, drinks and there was a birthday card on the table  signed by Michael Jordan from the restaurant, which was a really nice touch. At the end of the meal they brought a piece of birthday cake with a candle in it .and sang Happy Birthday. Thanks for making her birthday special!"
09/30/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The food was phenomenal, service was quick and very attentive. Best crab cake in the world"
09/30/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great service and food!
09/29/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Our third time there... over the top all 3 times . Knowledgeable staff.. great wine list clean
09/28/2017,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Ive eaten here before and would give it 5 stars across the board... but this time I'm not sure the quality was there. We had filet which were thin and dry and ordered it rare which was medium rare.  Potatos were okay at best, same with their salad.  Only thing we enjoyed was the $10 garlic bread and paid $220.  I won't be returning... very disappointed."
09/28/2017,Annie1,4.0,my steak was more well done then medium.  They wanted to make me another steak but i didn't want to wait and start again.  The steak was very tender and delicious. The manager compensated with dessert and coffee and a drink.  Overall my experience there was very good. Would definitely dine there again.
09/27/2017,Rev1,3.0,Worst meal we ever had at Michael Jordan's. Both dinners were served very salty. Must of been a new chef. Neither one of us could finish the meal because of the salt.
09/27/2017,JohnD,5.0,"Not our first time at Michael Jordan's but our first time using Open-Table. Both were excellent.  As usual we were not disappointed by the service, and food."
09/24/2017,RickyG,5.0,"Not a chain- an amazing family owned business and it shows- every detail great food, service-drinks-wine list and reasonably priced. We love their Chicago location too!"
09/24/2017,Pugs,5.0,Best steak I ever had! Asparagus was delicious too.  We will go back here for sure next time we are at Mohegan Sun.
09/24/2017,RobertR,5.0,Everything was great. Just the noise level is way to high. You need to yell to the person next to you to hear you
09/24/2017,LolaK,5.0,Food was excellent and the service was even better!! A great hot spot!!
09/24/2017,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Food was excellent but service was so rushed we were out in an hour. Very expensive so should have been more leisurely
09/23/2017,RonD,5.0,"Got the bone in filet, it was the best steak I have ever eaten."
09/23/2017,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Over priced
09/22/2017,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"Poor service, too loud, food was too salty.  We'd been here before and loved it. Now I don't care if I ever go back again. Very disappointed"
09/21/2017,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Usually the food is great, however I wasn't so fortunate this time. I must say the NY strip was cooked perfectly, however I had to wait 5 min. For the sauteed onions to arrive after I received the steak . The garlic bread was even longer even though I asked for it to come with the meal. It was also just buttered bread, lacked any flavor without the blue cheese sauce. They did remove the charge for both but still very disappointed. Was so looking forward to a great meal."
09/21/2017,Lori,3.0,Food was good but prices were too much for us..one time visit. would not go back again.
09/21/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great service and great food great atmosphere a must stop by if in Connecticut you will love the food and people just a all around good time
09/20/2017,justvisiting,4.0,"The oysters were a bit too grainy and my shrimp was overcooked. But everything else was perfect. The petite filet melted in my mouth and was cooked to perfection (medium rare) and the ribeye was cooked the same, perfect. We didn't try dessert as we were so full. The hubs loved his mango mojito."
09/18/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Food was out of this world!! Service was great!!!
09/17/2017,Njdiner,5.0,Great meal open late night. Perfect for after the show. Lobster fantastic and creamed spinach a must. Rolls amazing
09/16/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Dinner was fabulous. Top quality steaks and sides. Service was excellent. Can't wait to return.
A definite 5 stars!"
09/16/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"service was Great and very friendly
drinks and apps were very good
we had porterhouse for two..I was expecting a steak like I have at Peter Lugers. Steak was not even close to Lugers"
09/16/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Anniversary
09/15/2017,MichaelH,3.0,Food was ok but way overpriced. Noise level was out of the roof! Could not hold a conversation even screaming! Would not recommend.
09/13/2017,Lifeatseaforme,4.0,"If it wasn't for the brown lettuce in the Caesar Salad, the meal would have been perfect."
09/12/2017,DaleS,5.0,"Without a doubt the best Restaurant in Mohegan Sun, CT. The taste and service was second to none. A little pricey, but you definitely get what you pay For!!!!!!"
09/11/2017,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"You really just paided for the name. The steak I got was the aged mj23 and  was ok not crispy on the outside and was not juicy. The service was good, although I asked for a different table with plenty open and was refused saying it would be a extra 45 min wait, because the table we sat at was right by the noisy bar and close to the door with the draft bring unbearable. Needless to say I was not impressed nor would I recommend this place to anyone to go out on a date or anniversary."
09/10/2017,Srtaz,5.0,"Excell Food and service, well worth value. Great atmosphere, had a booth so a little more private. The garlic bread fondue is a must"
09/10/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Outstanding ribeye (as always)
First time we had the Pork Chop - which was definitely the BEST  pork chop I have ever had, seasoned and chared to perfection!
This is the third time we visited this restaurant and look forward to returning."
09/09/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Both had the special which was a petite filet, roasted lobster tail and seared scallops (Fantastic) don't forget to order the garlic bread with cheese fondue to start your meal!!!!"
09/08/2017,DennaB,4.0,Anniversary
09/07/2017,AnneN,3.0,Overall we had a good dinner. The food was good the tomato and burrata salad was delicious and we really enjoyed the garlic bread app.  The steaks and sides were decent.  The only downside was when we got our main courses just a few minutes after getting our starters. We weren't finished with starters so we definitely felt rushed at that point.  Our server was super nice and did a great job.  It was just the timing that we didn't love.
09/05/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We occasionally dine here when visiting the Casino, meeting up with friends.  We are never disappointed with the incredible service!   The food is amazing, regardless of which dish you choose. 
I would recommend this restaurant  as it is well worth the cost."
09/03/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The food was amazing, and the service was as well. The only disappointment was that we were seated right next to what my understanding was a water station, and the servers were all congregated around it.  Other than that we had a great date night, and will definitely be returning soon, just hopefully not in the same spot."
09/03/2017,Chacha,5.0,"the best steakhouse in New England!
always consisntent, better than Ruth Chris and Morton's!"
09/01/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Had dinner with a few friends before catching a concert.  The food at Michael Jordan's was excellent, as it has been every time.  The service was also adequate, but not perfect.  We ordered a pair of appetizers, garlic bread and oysters for the table, as well as a salad course, and steaks.  The salads were served before the appetizers, and the appetizers came out practically at the same time as our main courses.  All of the food was terrific, and comes highly recommended.  They also managed to get us in and out in plenty of time for the concert.  At a restaurant of this caliber, though, it shouldn't be unusual for a table to order three courses, and it could've been handled better."
09/01/2017,CVB1969,3.0,Our water was great however service was very slow and the food was only ok.  Garlic bread was good.  The Caesar salad was very wet and soggy with a heavy fish taste (we didn't eat it) .  Creamed spinach amazing and the short rib cavatelle good if you don't feel like a steak.  Filet was good.  Mixed blackberry sour was boring.  Wine was great.
09/01/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Super romantic. Staff is very professional, knowledgable and courteous. Food is super delicious. Definitely order the Delmonico medium rare plus, with the lobster mashed potatoes."
08/31/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Went there for my husbands birthday!! The food was absolutely delicious and the service was so pleasurable.  We have already recommended this restaurant to a few people. We are coming back for my birthday.  One of the best meals I have ever had!!  I give this restaurant 5 Stars!!
08/31/2017,LisaH,5.0,"This was our first time dining here. The food us excellent from start to finish. What I didn't like was the hostess. We had a reservation at 5 and she told us to ""step inside"" because they just opened. I thought that was very rude!!"
08/27/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Every time we go it's consistent. The food is always perfect and Chris my server who seems to always wait on us is fantastic. My favorite spot at the Sun.
08/27/2017,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"We ordered the porterhouse for two cooked medium. When it came the filet side was well done and the other side was medium rare.  Also our server, when delivering the steak, put the dish on the table pushing everything on the table aside with the dish. I've never seen that before in a high end steakhouse."
08/27/2017,OpenTable Diner,1.0,Food was not as expected. Poor.
08/27/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,It was a great night!!   Waitress was great!   Food was delicious!!   A little disappointed with the dessert but all in all everything was good!!
08/26/2017,CTwinegirl,4.0,"Our server Danielle was AMAZING! She was personable, warm, friendly, knew exactly when to check in, was passionate about wine, knowledgeable about the menu and totally on point. One of my best service experiences this year!"
08/26/2017,DebraM,5.0,Food was excellent. My petite filet was cooked perfectly. My sister is the lamb chops that were outstanding my cousin had the crab cake appetizer which was huge!! Waitress was lovely
08/26/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We mistakenly thought our reservation was for 7:30 (it was actually for 7:00). But we were seated right away anyway and had excellent service. The food was delicious, hot, presented well and good sized portions...not overwhelming.  We had a great dinner. A bit loud there but we didn't mind; we could still conversate.  Thank you, we'll definitely be back!"
08/26/2017,AnnS,3.0,"Had a reservation and got seated promptly which was great since there was an overwhelming amount of people there. For a steakhouse though, I was EXTREMELY disappointed in the steak. My boyfriend and I both ordered medium and the steak was well done. Most of it tasted like burnt hamburger meat. And for the price it wasn't good. The server also didn't come over to ask how the meal was and we were starving so we ate what we could and left the rest. I certainly won't be going back there again."
08/26/2017,Izzy,5.0,"Food was great and our waitress was awesome!
The prices are high but then again your at the casino."
08/26/2017,NYCFoodGal,5.0,This place is fantastic! We went there for a birthday dinner before a show at the Mohegan Sun. The staff was more than accommodating with our time schedule for dinner and the show. Incredibly professional. Wonderful food. Would love to go again!
08/26/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Food was great. Steak was soft, tender and cooked to perfection. Lobster was over cooked slightly but the scallops were delicious. The meatball appetizer was impressive and had a nice heat to it. The wait staff was very attentive. Overall great experience."
08/26/2017,RJAGuy,3.0,"Always ok - never exceptional.  I love the staff! Food is always ""good"" but never memorable."
08/24/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,My husband and I love this place. Every time we visit Mohegan Sun we always make reservations at Michael Jordan's! Delicious food and outstanding wine/drinks. Can't wait to go back!
08/23/2017,UnMarketing,5.0,"Everything was perfect. Server was awesome, took special note of son's peanut allergy and came back and confirmed after talking with the chef. Steaks were melt in your mouth. Try the Parmesan truffle crust. So good!"
08/21/2017,Silvers2,4.0,"Food was very good but not cheap.  Extensive wine list. 
Good apps. Main course done well. Our side of mushrooms was outstanding. Only problem was when they brought out the wrong apps. 
Also felt rushed through the meal. Would have liked to have taken the tone to enjoy the place v"
08/21/2017,SusanS,5.0,Visited MJ's once again this month and had excellent service and food.  The staff is always friendly and courteous and wanting to please.  The pork chop is always fantastic!
08/20/2017,BlancaK,5.0,We've been here a couple of times and it has been a great experience. Food is delicious and the service is excellent.
08/19/2017,dhdd,4.0,Great food and very busy because of number of venues there the evening we were there. But the service and food was still great.
08/19/2017,BillH,5.0,"Steaks and chops were impeccably prepared.   Sides were wonderful.  Shrimp cocktail was disappointing though.  More horseradish, not frozen."
08/19/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"This place is so fun and comfortable to get a group together or romantic for just 2.  Great food, drinks and atmosphere.  Love it"
08/19/2017,Overpriced,5.0,"The food was fantastic, but it was a bit pricey. Two people split one entree and had one drink apiece and it was $158 plus tip. That makes this place a once a year trip."
08/18/2017,Lnzeeloo,5.0,"Michael Jordan Steakhouse was worth the hour drive and the expense. It is comparable to other steakhouses as far as price, but the food was above and beyond other competitors. Everything was amazing from the appetizers to the dessert and our service was impeccable. I highly recommend the garlic bread with blue cheese fondue, the Wagyu Beef meatballs, and Creamed spinach side dish. They were all amazing!"
08/15/2017,MichaelK,5.0,Great food and we enjoying having our anniversary dinner there every year.
08/14/2017,DebraS,5.0,The food was wonderful and our wait staff were professional and attentive.
08/13/2017,huge,5.0,As a frequent customer I was disappointed with my Delmonico steak which is normally the best around. The waiter agreed and returned the steak to the chef who also agreed. No charge for the steak. Great customer service.
08/13/2017,RichardB,5.0,Usually find steakhouses to be overrated but everything from salad to dessert was first rate.
08/13/2017,JeVe,4.0,"The staff was wonderful!  However, we found the food to be pretty average and definitely not in the top tier for steaks.  Yes, they were tasty, but no way near as flavorful as other steakhouses we've dined at -- especially for the steep prices MJS commands.  That's not to say the appetizers, steaks, sides, and desserts weren't good.  They were.  Just not good enough for this price point -- we expected better.  We won't be in a hurry to return."
08/13/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Wonderful service and atmosphere was cozy. Only 1 thing my Delmonico steak was difficult to chew. The marbling meant to make it juicy and tasty missed its mark.it was more of a thick tough tendant. Every other steak at the table was delicious. As was the lamp chops,appetizers and sides."
08/12/2017,KristinH,5.0,Julie our server was absolutely amazing. This experience was extremely pleasant and so fun with her as  she was so attentive and personable
08/12/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Crab cake was the best I ever had. Steaks were cooked perfectly.
08/12/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"My only fault really is the price.   The steaks with 2 sides and 2 drinks and tip averaged out over 110$ a person.    That is kind of crazy.   I am very glad we went, it was a wonderful night, food was good.. my ribeye was fantastic, the MJ steak just ok.  I wouldn't go again."
08/12/2017,DoctorMarsh,5.0,"Expectations were not high after reading the mixed reviews but MJ steakhouse turned out terrific.  Tomato and Baratta was perfect and the Surf n turf was outstanding.   More importantly Robert, the waiter was really outstanding. He listened well and made sure everything was perfect. I was pleasantly surprised.   If you are at the Mohegan Sun, i  recommend you give it a try and make sure you bring a jacket or a sweater because it's cold inside."
08/11/2017,EricR,5.0,Staff got us in and out.  Food recommendations were great!
08/11/2017,Bd4077,5.0,Great food. Service is spot on.
08/11/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Went to Mohegan for a concert and ilke always Michael Jordan's impresses.  This restaurant is on par with some of the best I have been to including in Vegas.  Highly recommend the appetizer meatballs, very good and different flavor with the chipotle seasoning.  Cant go wrong with any of the steaks I am now partial to filets so that is what I order wherever i go.  Once again when at Mohegan and looking for an exceptional steak look no further."
08/10/2017,ChrisL,5.0,"Dinner was great!  A small issue with seating and Kenny the Mgr took care of it right away.  Had Chris K for waiter, very attentitive without being ever bearing.  ROsie was walking by and overheard me say it was my husband's birthday. Next thing you know, he was brought a free birthday dessert.  Thanks to all for a fantastic night!"
08/09/2017,RickP,5.0,"The steaks were out of this world! A friend's first steak (he's from a country that doesn't really eat steaks).  He said ""this is probably the best meal I've had in my whole life!"" He's 41 years old. Enough said. 😀👍"
08/06/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Food was good not super expensive, service excellent."
08/05/2017,DwayneR,5.0,"Absolutely fantastic meal and service.  The steaks are amazing - its hard to choose a ""crust"" from the creative list of options.  The mac and cheese is perfect."
08/05/2017,Thom,3.0,Medium rare filet was light pink. Asked server about it and was put off
08/05/2017,greatfood,4.0,"Have been to Michael Jordan's many times. The chefs must have changed because some of my favorites had changed. The garlic bread was no where near as good as it was. The dip for the bread was lacking in flavor, watery and sparse. I had to ask for more . The steaks were great. 
The service was also great."
08/04/2017,iTron,5.0,"Waiter excellent
Bring back lava cake with cinnamon ice cream"
08/04/2017,willie,4.0,"Usually we love everything about our experience at MJ's, but on this occasion the Delmonico Steal we ordered was far below expectations, it was pretty bad. We still loved the apps, the sides and our cocktails.

My advice would be this, order the Bone in Ribeye or the Filet or one of the other steaks we were always amazing, stay away from the Delmonico Steak"
08/04/2017,JDunn,4.0,My husband and I ate here for 2 reasons. 1- It was our two year anniversary of meeting and 2- It was on his bucket list to eat here (he is a HUGE MJ fan). We had a very enjoyable night. Prices were as expected. Food was delicious. Overall it was a great experience.
08/03/2017,Steakguy,5.0,Consistently great.  Food is wonderful and servers love the place
08/02/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Everything outstanding.  We should have been told about the charge for bottled water.  No biggie, but I did look on the beverage menu for the charge, just out of curiosity, and I didn't see anything.  Didn't diminish from the experience, and the water was good, just seems like it should have been mentioned ""we have bottled water available for an extra charge....""

Everything was outstanding .  Memorable in every way.  Salad was ""to die for"".  Service was fantastic."
07/31/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Restaurant is located in the Casino so can be a little loud and casual.  Food was great. Steaks superb.  Typical prices for a steakhouse serving USAD Prime meat.
07/29/2017,Eyyyyy,5.0,"Pleasently suprised. I like steak houses, and I've been to many. I thought the steak here was better than Flemings. A little less expensive too."
07/28/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We had a great experience. The food was cooked perfect and it was delicious. I was most impressed with the quality service. Our waiter and server were very attentive and friendly. They were sure to check on us frequently even when the restaurant became full. We had a reservation and were seated right away. They have tables for large groups, just for 2, and these cute little areas set inside the wall for more privacy. The restaurant is a but pricey. Ribeye was $57, sides are separate, and cocktails start at $12. However the steak was 23oz and everything was cook to perfection. With the excellent service, it is a place I will be visiting again.....When it becomes full, the noise chatter is high. However thats usual for people having a great time."
07/27/2017,GoodFoodGal,5.0,Was phenomenal
07/27/2017,Waltermitty,5.0,"Excellent service, wait staff does the best job I've ever seen. Steaks are out of this world"
07/26/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We ate at Michael Jordan's steak house before and were very pleased with everything. Once again it was wonderful. It was alittle busier this time around but service was great and the food delicious. Highly recommend!!
07/25/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,So apon making my reservation I started to read some good and some bad reviews I was Leary  about going but  went any was  every thing was perfectly cooked the filet mignon melted in your mouth don't listen to the bad reviews this place was awesome
07/24/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"MJ's is always exceptional, we live nearby, and are never disappointed."
07/23/2017,Stacey,1.0,"Midway through the dinner my friends and I both just looked at each other and said why is this our first time here ? We generally are at Mohegan a few times a month mostly for concerts but sometimes just to get away for an evening, we often eat in the buffet because of the choice credits I receive, however that night I was given $50 in food perks, everything about our experience at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse was excellent and we will be definitely going again"
07/23/2017,JaneN,5.0,"Food is always excellent and the wait staff kept their eye on the clock to make sure we weren't late for our show.  Our waiter Chris K was excellent, and was kind enough to give us the recipe for my new favorite drink, the ""mini beer"" that is mini (as in a generous shot) but is not beer.  Thanks so much Chris!"
07/23/2017,Maggie,5.0,Outstanding as always.  MJs delivers every single time!  Thank you.
07/23/2017,JohnM,5.0,I always dine here when up at the casino. Food and service are consistently excellent. The 45 day aged special is hard to beat if you like dry aged beef. The prices are reasonable and about what you would expect to pay at any top tier steakhouse in He tri-state area.
07/23/2017,Suesan,5.0,"Awesome, food was amazing great choice, service was great will go again"
07/23/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Food was amazing, and the service was second to none! Very pleased!"
07/23/2017,OpenTable Diner,2.0,We've had prime steak and this was not up to the norm we have experienced prior.  Service was very good and attentive and the steaks we did not eat were removed from the bill.  Trio of mashed potatoes filled us up as did the salad and crab cake we split prior to dinner.  Doubt we would return.
07/23/2017,Location,5.0,An elegant delicious meal at Mohegan Sun. Service was unbeatable. Our meal was not perfectly cooked to order and the staff could not have been MORE accommodating. The back room is very private and not noisy at all. The front room can be noisy. Overall a classy meal! Delicious flavor! Will come again.
07/23/2017,Dave,5.0,We had plans to celibate our anniversary.  I noted that on our reservation and the staff could not have been more accommodating.  Our waiter reviewed the house specials and helped us settle on entrees we were both very pleased with.  We had a great booth location and the manager stopped by to see if everything was was okay.  I would definitely recommend the location.  It was a great dining experience.
07/23/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Great ribeye and amazing chocolate cake.
07/22/2017,SemperFi,5.0,MJ's is always great. As with any restaurant on occasion there are minor food miscues or service issues but all in all MJ's is the best restaurant going at Mohegan Sun!
07/22/2017,Irisjade,5.0,My husband and I really love this restaurant!!  We had a reservation for last Sat. night  and we got a very nice table in the corner.  I had the 10 oz Filet with a smoked blue cheese crust which was cooked to perfection.  My husband had the New York Sirloin with truffle parmesan crust which was also cooked to perfection. The service staff was very friendly and worked as a team.   We were too full for desert.
07/22/2017,OpenTable Diner,3.0,i have had  a much better steak  a j gilberts  in glaston bury  and the  11$  patato  was  not worth  1 dollar   i spent  500$  for my  anv.  with my family  and got  a  50 dollar meal  i will never go back
07/22/2017,JulieB,5.0,"If you are looking for great food, great service and impeccable staff, then you've got the right place! Their steaks are awesome, and cooked like you ordered. Seafood fantastic! Appetizers and cocktails, so yummy! Need I say more!"
07/22/2017,TJMAXX,5.0,Memorial birthday dinner! Drinks and food were exceptional as was the wait staff. Got the surf and turf and it was one of the best meals I've ever had! Michael Jordan would be proud!
07/21/2017,Dave,4.0,"Very, very good as we celebrated a birthday at the restaurant."
07/21/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Consistently friendly,professional, service. Lovely menu with food and wine,cocktails always delicious, and fine quality. We enjoy a beautiful meal every single time we visit. Highly recommend this Michael Jordan's!"
07/21/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Everything was delicious from the apps to dessert!!! Key lime pie was to die for!! Cheesy garlic bread was crazy good!!
07/21/2017,JeffR,5.0,Celebrating 4 quarters of high honors!
07/21/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The food was excellent and the service was phenomenal!  We had a great experience.  Try the garlic bread, clam chowder and the Delmonico steak.  All delicious!"
07/20/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,My husband and I went on a date night there and It was fabulous. Our server Chris was great. He had fantastic customer service skills. Made recommendations for dessert and it was right on point. My husband and I were very satisfied. The hostess was very amicable.
07/18/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Retirement
07/18/2017,love2eatout,5.0,We were here  at the Mohegan Sun for one night and picked this restaurant because it was a steakhouse. Food was pricey but outstanding! Filet was super tender.  The service was excellent.   Nice place for a special occasion.
07/18/2017,keithb,5.0,"Great place to go to for a high end meal.  Not a cheap meal, but it is always fantastic."
07/17/2017,SusanS,5.0,"Amanda, the manager, realized that we had been waiting for our server to approach us and took action.  She sent the server over immediately and made sure that we were totally satisfied with the service and food.  She was more than gracious in compensating part of meal.  It just proved to us how important it is to Michael Jordan's that their patrons are completely satisfied."
07/17/2017,cappy,5.0,"We have had dinner at Michael Jordan's several times for special occasions.  Everything about the experience was excellent.  If you want good food, you have to pay the price and Michael Jordan's is no exception.  Would highly recommend to anyone."
07/16/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"This was my 2nd time there and was just as good as the first.  We had the same server, Jessica , who is absolutely fantastic, personable and a pleasure to have her as our server.   BUT....I wrote a good review our last time there and praised her. The response was. ""We will let Jessica know of your compliments during our staff meeting. When I asked her last night, she knew nothing about it.. please don't humor my review and tell me something that isn't so.   That makes me not want to go there anymore.  Thanks and awaiting your response    Dominic"
07/15/2017,Fds1103,5.0,"Extraordinary service and outstanding food!!  If you're at Mohegan Sun and don't make it a point to go to MJ's, you're CRAZY!!!! Best steak on the planet!!!"
07/14/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The good and service were good.  The fries were way too salty!  We sat near the front and the noise level was horrific!  We could barely hear each other.
07/14/2017,WendyC,5.0,"Excellent, as always.  Consistently good food, service and ambiance. Well done, MJ."
07/13/2017,DeRog,5.0,"Great service and food. One of our favorite restaurants. Steak always comes out perfect. Best crab cakes! No fillers, just crab."
07/13/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Food was amazing 
I work in an amazing steak house
And this was delish 
But $85 for a steak"
07/09/2017,MelodyC,5.0,One of our favorite and special places.  A must each time we are at the casino.
07/09/2017,Sully,5.0,Excellent food and superior service.  Very nice and enjoyable evening with family celebrating a birthday.
07/08/2017,CCC8,5.0,Our waitress was very attentive. We will go back again when we are in the area.
07/07/2017,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"The worst Delmonico steak I ever saw, tough and fatty.  staff was apologetic but did not remove steak from bill.  Six guys ran a $700.00 tab, it was not the money, it's the principal.  None of us are ever going back.

Waitress was fantastic, however."
07/07/2017,yummyfood,5.0,"The food was delicious, but a bit on the pricey side. $11 for a baked potato, YIKES,"
07/04/2017,Kellykel,4.0,Very good except my filet mignon was over cooked. My birthday dinner and a steak house did not cook to perfection as it should be. It was taken off bill
07/03/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"We had Chris K for our waiter and he was fabulous! Funny, nice, knew the menu/food and able to answer questions. Gave great recommendations and made us feel special. Would ask for him again!"
07/02/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,I thought the lamb chops (while quite delicious) were a tad on the small side. Three would be a better serving size.
07/01/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,I loved every aspect of last night. You guys truly made our first date one for the record books. I think I'll even get a second date!!!!
07/01/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Wonderful steaks and great service! Nice selection of food
07/01/2017,JuneG,4.0,"The food was delicious and we had a very good waitress.  The food is a bit pricey as everything is ala carte but still great.  

Our only issue was a nearby diner who was quite loud and swearing and yelling very loudly.  Manager did come over and apologize, it was just that this display ruined the ambience."
06/30/2017,DianeD,5.0,"This my favorite restaurant at Mohegan Sun Casino.  We go several times a year and it is always amazing. 
Especially the garlic. Fondue. Bread"
06/30/2017,eddrotman,5.0,It was excellent but I wanted to use a $20 earned reward but couldn't
06/30/2017,JeffR,5.0,Anniversary
06/30/2017,Barney,5.0,I dine at Michael Jordan's every time I come to Mohegan Sun. I love the Rib Eye Steak and the service. Michael Jordan's is one of my favorites.
06/29/2017,MMH8,2.0,"We were looking forward to returning to MJ's, but it was disappointing.  Restaurant 1/4 full, but service terrible.  Started off okay, then our waiter no where to be found.  Waitress offered to clear plates that had been sitting for quite a while.  We asked to see dessert menu-nothing.  Waiter finally cane back to ask if we wanted dessert. Yes, we did--10 minutes ago.  Just got check and left.  Food good as always, but ruined by service."
06/29/2017,Mary,5.0,My husband s birthday was made more memorable by eating here It is our favorite steakhouse We come here every2-3 months Food and service is spot on every time We are never disappointed here
06/28/2017,AndrewsJ,4.0,"My husband and I went there for dinner.  I loved that we could share sides and appetizers and still take some home!
Mashed potatoes were delightful and staff was extremely attentive (but didn't over do it)"
06/28/2017,SamD,5.0,"Best Filet Mignon I have ever had, wonderful! The sides were delicious also and the Strawberry Lemondrop is yummy!"
06/27/2017,TJBrown,5.0,"Sons 21st birthday along with my father in law, steak dinners were incredible! We had a great time, food was delicious. Waiter was excellent, Highly recommended"
06/25/2017,PeterK,5.0,"Awesome steaks, sides, apps, desert."
06/24/2017,Carolyn,4.0,We had great food and great service. It was a little pricy.
06/24/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Petite fillet was wonderful. Portion size just enough and cooked medium perfectly. Brocolini was a little hard to my liking...but corn was delicious. I think there garlic bread with blue cheese fondue should be there house bread it's very good...but really not an appetizer you should pay for.
06/23/2017,JodyF,3.0,Steak was ordered medium rare...it was raw. By the time see her checked hubby was done eating. Very loud but it was extremely busy. Sides of asparagus and roasted corn although large serving size was swimming in butter and extremely salty. Biggest complaint...i got my foot caught in the swinging doors between restaraunts and bruised the top of my foot badly. When I told the staff I was offered a cocktail. Then asked if I wanted to fill out an incident report. I declined bit the least they could have done was comp our dinner.  Manager was working his tail off...but really surprised he didn't take care of us.
06/23/2017,LoriR,5.0,This is the best steakhouse around. This was our third time at the restaurant and we will be back again.
06/23/2017,notalocal,5.0,"We had a variety of items. Started with the lobster dumplings which were not what we expected, ok, but not wonderful. They were fried which detracted from the smooth texture and flavor of the lobster. Two of us had the short rib with cavetelli. This was a phenomenal dish. I was expecting more pasta and less short rib, but very good and hearty. Two large well done flavorful short ribs atop cavetelli pasta. Husband had the scallops, far less hearty but very good. Four scallops atop a puree, more for the lighter appetite. Service was spectacular. Jewels was just that a rare gem. thank you."
06/23/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Excellent food and service though a bit overpriced (food and wine) like most places at the casino.  The restaurant set up feels crowded so not the greatest location if you want a more private setting  but can't go wrong if you want a great steak and attentive service.
06/22/2017,cherylc,4.0,"Food, especially steaks, is very good.  A bit pricey but you get high quality.  A meat lovers heaven at Mohegan Sun."
06/22/2017,TroyT,4.0,"Porterhouse for two was great!  Great mushrooms. Asperagus and baked potato not that good. Garlic bread ok, not great. Martini was good and cold."
06/22/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Amazing food, excellent service. We look forward to going here every time we visit Mohegan sun"
06/22/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Had family come to stay with us from out of town and just had to bring them to our favorite restaurant.  Rob was fantastic as was Jorge in their attention to details.  They were blown away with the quality of the food as well as the professionalism from everyone we interacted with.  I cannot recommend this restaurant enough.
06/21/2017,KeithM,5.0,"Steak is a must. 4 of us ordered 4 different steaks, and they were all spot on. 
The cream spinach was a little disappointing. We didn't like the bread crumb topping... it kinda ruined it."
06/18/2017,BethAnneM,5.0,Food was out of this world. Service was great as well...steak cooked perfect. A little too loud for an upscale restaurant. Other then that everything was on point. We will be back
06/18/2017,plister215,5.0,Our seventh anniversary dinner. The service is top notch and so is the food.
06/18/2017,Steaklover,5.0,"My husband and I went for our anniversary,We have eaten here many times and have never had a bad meal,they are always busy but the food and service is great !"
06/18/2017,Rocky,5.0,The food is always a step above and always consistent. After eating there a number of times now I would have to say it's in the top five best steak houses I have ever eaten at and I have eaten at a lot of them. LOL.  Side dishes are fantastic but maybe it would be good to have one with some kind of pasta( maybe a fresh angel hair with garlic & oil). The only complaint that I could ever have is that this time was a little too noisy. That being said I always recommend MJ's to anyone who enjoys good food. see ya next weekend.
06/17/2017,MichaelJordanForThreee,5.0,Worth checking out. Service was really good. Atmosphere was really nice. Food was awesome. Lots to choose from. Highly recommend trying out
06/16/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Fabulous food & atmosphere. Pleasant Staff. Outstanding Hostess, Thank you again, Josie. See you again in August for sure😊"
06/16/2017,JGMJGM,4.0,Caesar salad good but for price should have had white anchovies.    Also key lime pie was soupy.   Also was noted to be a birthday dinner when booking but no acknowledgement of such.
06/15/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"My wife and I made reservations for 0615, our 32nd anniversary.  When we arrived at the restaurant we told the hostess that we were celebrating our anniversary and asked for the best table available.  She was happy to accommodate us and seated us at a very nice almost private booth.  She obviously told our server and he brought over two glasses of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary.   We both thought that  was a really nice touch.  On to our server!  His name was Chris K.  We have to say that Chris k did a great job.  From the start he was there offering suggestions for an appetizer and was happy to answer any menu questions that we had. The food was well presented and paced perfectly by Chris K.  We both had the chopped salad.  My wife had the Filet Mignon with mac n cheese as a side.   I had the Rib eye steak and the baked potato as a side.  We followed up with the cheese cake for desert.  I will say again that everything was cooked perfectly and we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner much to the credit of Chris K.  I would also like to mention that the manger, Jimmy was present in the dinning room and stopped by a least twice to make sure we were enjoying our dinner. We look forward to returning in the future to celebrate another anniversary."
06/15/2017,FoodLover,1.0,I got a lobster dinner and was very disappointed. There were so many shells in it. I did express my feelings when asked and the manager came over and apologized. He said he would comp something off the bill. We received the bill and he comped a $13 glass of wine. The lobster meal cost $60. I think that is absolutely ridiculous to comp only $13 when I ate none of the meal due to the shells. I am very disappointed and will not recommend this place. I also ask to be contacted about this horrible experience.
06/15/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Our dinner started with the garlic bread appetizer and Caesar salad. The bread was amazing. The Caesar salad we were NOT impressed with. Lettuce was wilted and WAY to much dressing, tge lettuce was drowning in it! I did mention this to the manager Jimmy. My hubby had the 23 oz bone in rib eye and I had the Petite Filet. Both steaks were excellent! Cooked perfectly! Our waitress Jennifer was wonderful. She was attentive, personable and friendly. We have dined here before and overall a good place. My only complaints would be the salad and maybe a bit pricey!"
06/14/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The service was outstanding.  Our drinks were less than perfect and my husband's was remade by a different bartender.  My filet was average, slightly overcooked.  My husband enjoyed his lamb chops which were large and very tasty.  We had the trio of mashed potatoes which were ok.

We were given a glass of champagne for our anniversary which was very nice.  I think it is very overpriced and I would rather spend that money in another restaurant."
06/13/2017,FancyH,4.0,"Service was very good from reception through entree delivery.  Two entrees and three sides were good, one entree was barely warm.  The problem was addressed by both our waiter and a manager promptly and was satisfactory afterward.  We've made several trips here... this was the first problem we've encountered. We'll be back again!"
06/13/2017,Luv2dine,5.0,The filet with bone in was outstanding. The garlic bread with fondue was as well. I could have drizzled everything with the fondue.
06/12/2017,Sarahlemi,4.0,Food was amazing. Waitress sat on our order for about 15 minutes before putting it in but once we got our food the steak just melted in your mouth. Best steak ive had in my life
06/12/2017,Seasonedtraveller,5.0,It's a steakhouse and the steaks may have been the best I've ever had and I've been to a lot of the major steakhouses around the US.   The wine list was extensive.   I would definitely go there again.  It is very expensive.
06/11/2017,conn,5.0,"We were at Mohegan for a concert, and had a great experience at the steakhouse.  Our food was excellent as was the service.  We would enjoy a return visit!"
06/11/2017,MattS,5.0,"Excellent staff, always attentive to details, food is excellent. My favorite restaurant!!"
06/11/2017,DeniseL,2.0,"My family went to Michael Jordan's to celebrate my sons graduation and my birthday.  We all had shrimp cocktail and steaks 2 filet mignonand 2 delmonico). The tab came to $450 without the tip!  Quite high, but it wouldn't have bothered me had the service been good. Our waitress started out 'spot-on', but when her friend and new baby arrived, even waving her over we could not get a bit of service...absolute ly terrible. We were so angry at that point we elected to take dessert to go...the 23 layer chocolate cake was dry and crumbly as though it was stale...at $14/slice it should have been amazing. Very disappointed.  We will spend our celebrations at Mortons & Ruth Chris from now on."
06/10/2017,AnnetteT,3.0,"The food was great. Our server was over the top courteous. My husband and I were very over dressed. The review said it was business casual but people were there in jeans ,tee shirts and sneakers. I was hoping for a quiet romantic dinner but that was the opposite. The table behind us was yelling profanities."
06/10/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,My nephew picked this restaurant for his birthday dinner.  Great place definitely should make reservations ahead
06/10/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Excellent service and excellent food! From the time we walked in to the time we left, we were treated like royalty!"
06/09/2017,SemperFi,4.0,Normally we have great service and food. Not up to par this visit. Had an issue with a side order and waiter was kind of aloof. Maybe just an off night!
06/04/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The food was exceptional!  Our reservation was for right when they opened so it wasn't busy which made it nice. It would be a great place for a date or to celebrate an anniversary. The staff was fun, pleasant and right there if you needed anything.  Very enjoyable!  Thank you."
06/03/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great service .. order a slice of cake  if your wishing happy birthday's complimentary  basketball cake is nasty
06/03/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"We we seated on a very busy isle right out side the kitchen.  We were not happy about that so they moved us to a different table without much fuss.  Our original waiter was a little grumpy but the new waitress  at the new table was much nicer.  The food was great as always, even better once they remembered my shrimp. The restaurant was very loud, as always."
06/03/2017,James,5.0,Food was great. Noise level suitable for comfortable conversation without shouting. Nice atmosphere
06/03/2017,linny,5.0,We were only at Mohegan sun for one night so the birthday girl wanted steak. We found everything to be delicious from the steak to lobster. Salads were big. Service was great! Would go back in a flash. Make reservations cause it gets crowded!
06/02/2017,JoeU,4.0,Very good food. Great specials. Cooked to perfection. Great wait staff
06/02/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,I went to Michael Jordan's for my 21st birthday. The waitress brought me a birthday card and a free dessert mousse. It was an awesome experience.
05/29/2017,JDKJ,4.0,We were at Mohegan to watch Chris Tucker's show and stopped in after the show to grab a bite. Worked out well as I used open table to bump up the reservation time 45 minutes when the show ended earlier than anticipated. Food was excellently prepared and service very professional.  As we were finishing our entree Chris Tucker and entourage sit down at the table next to ours for dinner. Awesome!
05/29/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Our Steaks were cooked perfectly,  sides were great too.  Our waiter was on point.  He was knowledgeable and checked in on us just enough."
05/28/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Michael Jordan's is always a great place to escape to. Their staff is most efficient and kind and attentive. Their quality of food is always amazing and well prepared especially the fire corn. You won't go wrong dining there
05/27/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Crab cake was fishy but to their credit,  they took it off the bill.  Waitress was great! Porterhouse Steak for tow was the best I've had.  WE ordered it medium and it was cooked to perfection!"
05/27/2017,CW22,5.0,Horseradish encrusted filet mignon and macaroni and cheese were delicious.
05/27/2017,Twoducks,5.0,"One of top three dining experiences my wife and I have ever had.   From atmosphere to food,service, accommodation of our seating request, and menu without a doubt the best executed steakhouse I've ever been to.   Peter Luger in NYC does not measure up.   Great job!"
05/27/2017,OpenTable Diner,2.0,Overpriced for mediocre food
05/27/2017,KateS,5.0,"All of my expectations were beyond exceeded. The moment you walk in to the restaurant you feel this warmth and coziness that is undeniable and quite comforting. The service was impeccable, from the hostesses to our server (Chris K), who went above and beyond and was very attentive to our needs. As a newbie to this restaurant, Chris K was able to guide us in creating the perfect pairings among our appetizers, entrees, and sides. He suggested the garlic bread with cheese fondue, and we were beyond happy that Chris K made that suggestion because we would've been so sorry to miss out on such culinary greatness; hands down the BEST garlic bread we have ever had. A ""slam dunk"" at its finest. The signature cocktails were fantastic, the peartini was perfect - not too overbearingly strong or sweet-just right. Next time we will remember to make room for dessert. 
We look forward to coming back to the MJs steakhouse. Will definitely be recommend it to everyone we know."
05/24/2017,CSP1260s,5.0,Stopped in for our anniversary dinner.
05/21/2017,AcbandRpb,4.0,"We had a great meal, we absolutely loved the lobster mashed potatoes!  The wine was excellent.
The service fabulous and we loved it!"
05/20/2017,belle59,4.0,This is a flagship restaurant in a casino and is a high priced venue.  That being said the service was excellent and the food quality was also well above average.  Avery good restaurant with a price tag to match
05/20/2017,JoeU,4.0,Great food. Served hot. Good taste. Pleasant server
05/20/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great evening.
05/20/2017,Lambchopporky,5.0,Everything you eat at Michael Jordan's melts in your mouth. I have had many many many meal here and have never had a bad one.
05/20/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"I took a group of close friends here for dinner, overall a great experience as the food was delicious. Our waiter was great, timely and knew his wines very well. The only knock would have been the host who felt the need to roll her eyes and talk to the group in a condescending manner, but we quickly forgot about her. Steaks were done as ordered, and the seafood tray was well presented. We all left very happy."
05/20/2017,GinaK,5.0,Food was amazing. We appreciated the anniversary card on the table. My only complaint was went we got there we expressed to the server how hungry we  were and asked for bread and we waited for bread when the appetizers arrived.
05/20/2017,Firstvisit2021,5.0,"We came for our anniversary and had a nice time.  Prices were steep, but food and service were high quality."
05/19/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Yes, MJs is expensive but I drive 90 minutes each way once a year for a special occasion.  The food NEVER disappoints.  We took our friends this time and they are hooked."
05/19/2017,JoaquinP,5.0,Service was impeccable. Food was awesome ambiance was memorable...
05/18/2017,tedm,5.0,Awesome as usual. Never disappointed at Michael Jordan's. I could live on the garlic bread with fondue.
05/17/2017,NoreenK,4.0,It was a nice restaurant with good service. The prices were typical for top tier steakhouses. The side dishes were large and excellent. Unfortunately the steaks were not as flavorful as those at other top steak house chains such as Flemings or Ruth Chris steakhouse .
05/14/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,A little pricey but by far the best steak I've ever had!  Food and service was amazing.
05/14/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Great time, great food, staff was excellent went there for mother's day my mom was impressed thank you"
05/13/2017,NicB,3.0,Food was decent. Service was awful. We were stuck at the last table in the back by an emergency exit and our waiter was hard to find for certain requests.
05/13/2017,LisaV,5.0,"The atmosphere is especially engaging in this gem!  The food was fresh, the wine list extensive and they also offer half bottles of wine which was helpful for one of the people in our party!  Waiter came to check on us frequently which is a plus. I had the short rib cavatelli which was AMAZING!!! The meat was incredibly soft amd seasoned deliciously. The pasta also tasted homemade!! A definite must of you ate in Mohegan Sun, try and make reservations because it is very busy on the weekends!! Enjoy!"
05/13/2017,LumarieD,5.0,The best steak house amazing!!! The server are amazing great services all around the atmosphere is great everything is great highly recommended
05/13/2017,Happyfamilywillvisitsoon,5.0,Food and service was great.  Very pricy. Very loud. Tables to close together. Will return just making an observation for the review.
05/12/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Amazing as always! One of our favorite restaurants!
05/12/2017,Katie,5.0,Wonderful night!
05/12/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Our food was excellent, service started out great but became slow as they became busy. 
Lighting was too low. Very dark inside and the server hit my chair at least 6 times while waiting on the table behind me, and he did not acknowledge or excuse himself."
05/12/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,My wife and I went on 38th Anniversary. The staff made our evening a special night. Thanks to everyone!
05/11/2017,tuscanyfan,5.0,"Excellent as always. This place is as consistent as you want in a restaurant.
We are going back in a few weeks."
05/07/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Food is amazing and service staff is great. I go everytime I go to Mohegan Sun. They never disappoint.
05/06/2017,eleanorc,5.0,always a great meal...we love it..great quality...drinks not impressive but food fantastic...steaks are awesome...side dishes as well...although chopped salad wasn't  chopped but was very good..
05/06/2017,ConcertGoer,5.0,"I've been to Michael Jordon's in Chicago and think the food and service at Mohegan Sun were better.  Steaks were top quality and cooked to perfection.  Seafood dishes (Salmon and Tuna) were also great.  Our reservation was immediately before a sold out concert at the casino, and restaurant was packed.  We got there about 15-20 minutes before the swarm and our service was great.  Shared the 23 layer chocolate cake between a group of 4 . . . and still didn't finish it.  Decadent!"
05/06/2017,ThomasG,4.0,"Great meal as always, however since we had an early reservation, 4:45 was only one available, our table was all the way up front, near the reservation desk, by the bar with lots of people waiting and hanging around watching us eat. All good but ambiance was extremely weak due to table placement. Recommend mentioning that when booking."
05/06/2017,Shoe,3.0,"Only apps this time, but service and food was great."
05/05/2017,JbAb,4.0,Service was good and attentive. Steaks were awesome.
05/05/2017,DonC,5.0,"This was my 3rd time dining at Michael Jordan's and they did not disappoint.  The Fillet Mignons were so tender that I probably could have cut them with a butter knife.  The creamed spinach and roasted corn were excellent as well.  The staff was attentive and addredsed all concerns promptly.  They re-folded the napkins and hung them on the chair everytime someone stepped away from the table, and wiped any spilled/dropped food each time dishes were cleared.  This restaurant is top notch -
 we will definitely return."
04/29/2017,DAVIDF,5.0,"Have been coming here since 2004, never a disappointment."
04/29/2017,StephenD,5.0,Had a wonderful dinner. Our waiter Chris K was terrific.I look forward to coming back again.

04/28/2017,MarieCallendar,5.0,Delicious steak place!   Great atmosphere and definitely delicious food and decor
04/28/2017,Maycee,1.0,"Absolutely  and amazing dinner ! we had the bone in filet and the smaller fillet for dinner and you cannot miss the bread appetizer with the blue cheese dipping sauce   Absolutely out of this world !!
 Service was great and we were seated promptly but be careful not to get in much after five or you will have a long wait !  Also be careful to ask the prices for the specials  because the fillet with the bone in was $92 ! An amazing piece though! 
Al  in all it was a great dinner and will definitely return  on our next visit to Mohegan sun !"
04/28/2017,karinm,5.0,"The best bartenders ever! Eric, Shirley, Jeff, CJ, Tim and Can't forget Ryan the food runner!! I love them all!! I never go any place else! And Chip .. the  executive chef , is the best!!  The food is perfection!!
You will not be disappointed!!"
04/27/2017,MikeRI,5.0,Great service & the food was outstanding!  Filet was amazing!
04/27/2017,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"The food and service were very good.  However, it was very noisy to the point that you could not have a good conversation.  Having eaten at the Michael Jordan cafe, we thought this would be more of a quiet place to enjoy a meal.  It was a bit disappointing."
04/26/2017,BostonCousin,5.0,"Excellent, as always.  Only restaurant I go to at Mohegan Sun."
04/24/2017,Claila,5.0,It was my boyfriends 30th birthday so it was for a special occasion and the staff was fantastic. They were attentive yet gave us our privacy and the food was phenomenal !!  We had the trio mash potatoes as a side - amazing !! Great place that I would recommend to anyone and most definitely return to.
04/23/2017,David,5.0,Extraordinary dinner.  Waiter knew everything on the menu.  He answered every questioned we had.  Just a wonderful place to get the perfect deserving dinner.
04/23/2017,4kidcrazy,5.0,The food was excellent and our waitress Jess was very helpful and friendly. She also knew a lot about Mohegan Sun which was helpful.
04/23/2017,BobbyL,4.0,"Enjjoyed our dinner. the noise level was slightly high but to ve expected on a Saturday night. reception and server staff were 'on the job'. 

tuna and scallop dinners were delicious. 

a favorite place of mine"
04/22/2017,MGBG,5.0,"Absolutely fantastic. We enjoyed the tuna tartar, crabcake, shortrib cavatelli, salt block chicken, & baked alaska. We were amazed at how excellent each dish was. Great portion sizes, beautiful plating, perfectly prepared. The prices were a bit high, but we will definitely return."
04/22/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We went to an MMA fight at the arena and decided to stop in for dinner. Great food! Great service!  It was an overall AWESOME experience!

04/19/2017,Nikki,5.0,Excellent Service
04/15/2017,lsalce,4.0,Food was good... it would be nice to have more veggie side options.  The restaurant was a little too dark and loud.  Service was friendly.  Overall a good experience.
04/15/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Chris K was our server and he did a great job. Excellent service!
04/15/2017,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Very disappointed with the quality of the food. All of us had filet mignon. When the food was brought to the table the aspect of the meet looked like a piece of charcoal-all black. We had ordered medium and the meat was cooked as ordered, but the meat was not tender at all. It was hard and dry. I am used to a filet mignon that the meat is juicy and tender and when you cut into it is like cutting butter."
04/15/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"My wife and I had a dinner date here since we were visiting the area, we weren't disappointed the server was knowledgeable, the food and service was excellent! Best crab cake I've ever had! Only regret was we didn't have room for dessert, so we'll definitely be going back"
04/15/2017,Reacher,5.0,Chris K was the best server we have had anywhere.  Complete attention to detail.
04/15/2017,mattC,5.0,Great experience with wait staff out of this world food.
04/14/2017,Pamy,5.0,We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. The service was wonderful. Steaks were cooked to our liking and were delicious. Great french fries.

04/14/2017,LongIslandGirl,5.0,We truly enjoyed our dining experience at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse and we plan to return.
04/14/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"First time experience at Michael Jordan's - at first glance of the menu it looks pricey. However, the food & service was worth every penny!"
04/12/2017,Bill,5.0,"Great food. Top quality. Prepared well. Extensive variety of wines. Enjoyed appetizer,  filet, potato and mushroom sides, sorbet desert topped off a great meal!"
04/11/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,It was awesome!! Loved everything from the appetizers to the entrees. Perfect!
04/10/2017,ACDined,5.0,"Awesome entrees and appetizers. Recommend the lamb, mashed potatoes combo side, and the garlic bread with blue cheese. Worth every penny."
04/09/2017,ShankNCaseyR,3.0,Atmosphere was great! Service exceptional. I wasn't impressed with the food.  Extremely overpriced.
04/09/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Great food, great service ! All of our steaks were cooked exactly to our liking and all of the sides from the Creamed spinach to the mac and cheese were excellent!"
04/09/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Food was amazing, service was excellent.. no complaints here!"
04/08/2017,Steve6180,4.0,"The staff was was on point,  food was good. The price on the other hand, were a little expensive.  I've eaten at Del Frisco's, Smith and Wellensky's and capital grill. The portions at Michael Jordan's food were a little small for the prices."
04/08/2017,Keith,5.0,"Great dinner, great service. The ambience was nice bit a little too dark. Could be a little more lit as my date couldn't see the menu without using a light from her phone. All in all was a nice evening."
04/08/2017,Beard1,4.0,The Strip steak was not their best. The meat has some nerves and stringiness to it. Not upto my standards for a $50 steak and below the prior standards I expect from Michael Jordans
04/02/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great food and wait staff was very informative when we asked about the meals. This is the best place to eat at Mohegan Sun
04/01/2017,D5432,5.0,"It was a crowded night.   OpenTable found a table, even though the front host said the next available seating was in 2 hours.  

I booked via OpenTable while standing in front of the host.  He was expecting the reservation to fail - and even called OpenTable to check the reservation.    With the reservation confirmed they seated us immediately. 

It's MJs - great steak.  Waiter even ensured each dinner choice was  gluten free after I mentioned restrictions.   Well done Chris!"
04/01/2017,Michael,5.0,It was my first guys weekend with my 8yr old son. My son is a steak lover so naturally I had to get him his first filet mignon at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse.  We had a great time and loved the food.  It was a great experience all around.
04/01/2017,MattyA,5.0,Great steak dinner.  Loved the 3-style mashed potato side.
04/01/2017,JaclynA,5.0,We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner! We never leave disappointed. Great service and amazing food!
03/31/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Overall pretty good.  Service was excellent and all the food was good except my wife's filet was overcooked.  Ambiance was good but it was very loud in general and there was a very loud table near us that was very distracting.
03/31/2017,PTVR,4.0,MIchael Jordan's Steakhouse has a very nice ambiance.  Our server Chris K was very polite and attentive.  Our filet's cooked perfectly!
03/31/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We love the crab cake appetizer. It’s the greatest!
03/30/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Definitely get the garlic bread! Filet and scallops were the best I've had. Awesome service from our server Chris K. Will definitely be back!
03/30/2017,VTZR1,5.0,"Excellent meal. Our server, Nancy, was a great,  and made the evening even more enjoyable. The food was excellent and prepared as requested. I do not like seasoning on my steak. The baked potato all I was looling for was ""traditional butter/sour cream and chives.""
The evening was so good that Kelly said we would be coming back, and that I had better make reservations for dinner when I book our next trip to Mohegan Sun."
03/26/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Our server, I'm so mad I cannot remember his name, but he was knowledgeable and smart and very very good to us!"
03/26/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Service was very good. Bread on table was warm and very tasty. We all had steaks which were all grilled to our liking. Wait staff Attentive to all our needs.
03/26/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Great restaurant, great food, greatly service"
03/25/2017,PeterZ,5.0,Great food!!!
03/25/2017,joannem,3.0,"Just not that great anymore. I have eaten here dozens of times.  Potato trio was lukewarm. So was crab cake. Overall, attention to detail has diminished and while the steaks were tender and tasty, the feeling of  having had an outstanding dining experience has disappeared. Not going back for a long time if ever. Disappointed."
03/25/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"MJ Steakhouse at Mohegan Sun never disappoints. From what open tables info My wife and I have been there around 80 times over a 10 year period. We've celebrated so many different milestones with large groups or just us!  Also I've eaten at every steakhouse that holds merit in the NY area also Vegas to Carribean.  
Our server Ryan we actually request now. We've been sitting in his section for at least 8 years. If he's not there we still have a great experience, but Ryan makes it much homier. Always asks how everyone is doing. Asks for our children. My wife shows him pics. It's very genuine. A good person. 
The food is excellent. I gave it 4 stars for this last dinner because I had an issue with the Bone in Filet Special. It seemed to be an end cut. Even medium rare it just didn't give the flavor other bone ins do, and was a little dry also. Not anyone's fault just wasn't my type of cut. I always stay with what I like. My wife try's to get me to eat different things and this night it didn't work out. Ryan was quick to put in a New York Strip and swap it out so I didn't miss eating with my wife. Great employees. I've never had bad service there.  One of the managers Amanda came over and apologized. This is how a restaurant is supposed to handle the situation. We've been to places where if something isn't right they get defensive. Not here. It's taken care of ASAP.  
Recommendations
The tuna tartare and chips (ask for Wasabi they don't put it in the tuna unless you request it! 
Great Caesar salad. 
With your entree def get the corn off the cob, it has spicey butter that is ridiculously good. We always order it and it's just a perfect side. Mashed potatoe trio I would stay away from just ask for regular whipped mashed and you will be very happy!
It was my wife's bday, but she didn't want a scene. I didn't say it to our server Ryan, but he overheard us and brought my wife out a dessert on the house with lit candles (no singing just a quick wish and she blew them out!"
03/23/2017,TracyP,4.0,"I have visited this location several times. Tonight was exceptionally busy. The lack of service showed it!  While the waiter and his helper were great, their lack of availability was noticeable. When around, our needs were attended to... all suggestions were spot on. Checking on us was non event and when it was time for the check I had to seek it out."
03/23/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We had a great meal and enjoyable evening. Our serverChris and his team were outstanding
03/23/2017,JeannetteB,5.0,The crab cake app was pricey but worth EVERY cent - chunks of crab with no fillers.  Filet melted in mouth and cooked exquisitely. Service was fabulous!
03/23/2017,BrendonH,5.0,"best meal ive ever had, the steak was perfect and everything about the resteraunt is awesome. im literally at a loss for for words for how good the entire exeperiance was from the service to the food. i will be back thats a fact"
03/21/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We thoroughly enjoyed our experience. Would definitely return. Waiters were awesome and I love that I used OpenTable. So convenient
03/19/2017,Hammockroad,5.0,Danielle our server and the busers were excellent! Perfect service!
03/19/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Perfect evening.
03/19/2017,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"We eat here all the time when we visit Mohegan; although service is always good my steak was terrible ,undercooked twice and tasted gamey. Never the case with the steaks there, truly disappointed."
03/18/2017,Nirvana,5.0,"We just went to Mohegan Sun for a weekend thing and ate our Saturday night dinner at Michael Jordan's.  The food was fantastic, I got a filet mignon and it cut like butter!  My husband got chicken and although it was tender it did lack a bit of taste.  We were seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant but still felt we had plenty of privacy.  The staff was spot on, never an empty glass.  I would recommend this to all my friends."
03/18/2017,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Overpriced for the quality of the food.  J Gilberts is much better
03/18/2017,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"The service was actually pretty good and our server was friendly,  definitely encouraged to upsell EVERYTHING though.   The restaurant was extremely loud,  we were celebrating our anniversary, but could barely hear each other.  The server brought usome a few glass of champagne for our anniversary which was very nice.    The prices were extremely high,  $10 higher than comparable restaurants (ie. Capital Grille).  My wife ordered the petite filet medium and it was overcooked, a tiny bit of pink in the middle,  but mostly grey all around and somewhat burnt on the outside.   I ordered the bone-in ribeye medium rare and it was cooked exactly the way I asked and it was delicious.   They did not have a side of regular mashed potatoes, but had a trio of regular,  lobster,  and bacon gouda mashed potatoes,  which was not bad.   The asparagus was outstanding and both of us enjoyed it.   Overall our experience was good,  but definitely subpar for the price that we paid.  I would not return again."
03/14/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Fabulous

Best meal I've ever had there and I've eaten there a good 15 times

Kitchen crew that night was best ever everything solid

This coming from a chef owner of a restaurant"
03/13/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Food was predictably pricy but excellent quality. Service was excellent. Overall an enjoyable experience
03/12/2017,Vozzy,5.0,"We were celebrating our anniversary and decided to celebrate at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse since we hadn't been there for some time.  Upon being seated we were presented with a nice card congratulating us on our anniversary.   Our waitress, Julie was very pleasant, fun and knowledgeable.  Offered a few suggestions and made sure we were well taken care of throughout our meal.  Our food was cooked perfectly and tasted excellent.  Even though we declined dessert because we were full from our meals, Julie surprised us with a wonderful Creme Brûlée to share compliments of the house.  And because it was so light and tasty we did end up finishing the whole thing!  We were very pleased with our choice for celebrating this special occasion, thank you to Julie and the rest of the staff at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse at Mohegan Sun!"
03/11/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Outstanding food and service; never had a disappointing meal here. The garlic bread with bleu cheese fondue is an absolute MUST! The filet was cooked perfectly and delicious. The bone-in ribeye was the same. We split a 1 pound baked potato and had the corn-off-the-cob. Always a great time. A little noisy, though, but still enjoyable!"
03/11/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great service as always. They never disappoint with the quality of the food or the friendly service
03/11/2017,OpenTable Diner,2.0,I have eaten here many times and it has always been a great experience...however this night was terrible my husband ordered the veal chop medium and I ordered the filet medium . His veal chop was well done so waitress said she would send it back and it would only be 7 minutes well it took 25 minutes so I ate dinner alone and while waiting the couple next to us were fighting loudly si by the time his food came out he lost his appetite 😒
03/10/2017,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"We came to the casino for my wife's birthday. We have always wanted to try mjs even knowing it was a a bit on the pricey side. First we orders 2 drinks that we great. Then shrimp cocktail that were not anything special because they were still warm. Then our dinner, she had the tuna steak that she said was cold and tasted like it was sitting out. I had the braised short rib cavatelli. I can honestly say it was the worst meal I have ever eaten. The pasta was still crunchy and the meal just tasted horrible. I have never complained to a restaurant before. I am a very easy going person. But to come to such a high class place and spend $141 on a meal that was less than fast food quality is very wrong in my opinion. We will never be back nor recommend this restaurant."
03/09/2017,SteakLover03031,3.0,"The $100 Porterhouse steak had lots of gristle on the strip side. I tasted the filet side and it was covered in salt.  For aged beef, it was poor quality. Save your money and eat elsewhere.  No one here knows steak."
03/09/2017,DAVIDF,5.0,"Always a great experience, coming here for 14 years now, at least 4 times a year."
03/09/2017,apron2,5.0,Over priced. Most things are ala carte---no garnishes. Ordered a petite filet mignon. It arrived on a large plate. Looked too stark but tasted delicious
03/09/2017,JaneN,5.0,The key lime pie was possibly the best I've ever eaten
03/09/2017,PamelaM,3.0,Our dinner (pre-Sting concert) was a Birthday celebration as I had indicated with reservation made though there was no recognition during our dinner.  Unfortunately the Birthday Girl's filet was overcooked rather than ordered medium rare which made the over-priced entrée not worthy.  We did enjoy the alcove booth seating & Nancy our server!
03/06/2017,Craig,5.0,Great meal - attentive service!!
03/06/2017,Wereg,2.0,"Just OK. Bone-in Kansas City strip was supposed to be Prime dry aged 28 days, sure didn't taste like it. Sides and bread were good. Not worth the price."
03/05/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Absolutely wonderful meal and wonderful service! We come every year to celebrate our anniversary!
03/05/2017,TriciaL,3.0,"Decor and booth were great ! Hostess was super accommodating and friendly. Great waitress service. 
Unfortunately food was just ok. Heavy dressing on Caesar salad. Porterhouse was s little dry and a bit over cooked for ""rare"" especially the filet part. Mash potatoes were somewhat tasteless. A bit disappointed."
03/05/2017,Red372,4.0,Good food & accommodated special dietary requests. Should be more acknowledging of birthday request other than a table card.
03/05/2017,CathyE,4.0,"Good was fabulous,  service needs some improvement."
03/05/2017,AlanW,4.0,"Dinner was for 4 to celebrate a birthday. Reservation was on time, seating was a quiet corner table, and food was awesome. We will return again."
03/05/2017,KimH,4.0,"Very enjoyable dinner - the food, the service and the ambiance were just what we were looking for."
03/05/2017,LisaH,3.0,It was good. Not worth the price though.  Second time there.  Had a table near the kitchen. Got stuck with staff flying by us all night on both sides of us.  Crazy place for a table and the bill was almost $700.00.   Felt like a fan directly above us.  We were cold.   Probably won't return but worth trying once or twice.
03/04/2017,JaclynA,5.0,"Excellent menu and service! I didn't realize the ceasar salad had anchovies paste in it, which I do not like. The server and later manager did it hesitate to offer something else and or remove it from the bill."
03/03/2017,Celine,5.0,"This was my 3rd visit to Michael Jordans steak house at Mohegan Sun & I have never been disappointed.  The food,  service & ambiance are phenomenal . It's one of the reasons I choose to stay at Mohegan Sun Vs. Foxwoods"
03/03/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,I've dinned here over 7 times within 5 years. I will be back and always reccomend to others! Amazing food along with amazing service!! A++
03/03/2017,Fela,5.0,"The service staff were pleasant. Seated right away in a booth. Highly recommend the garlic bread, crab cakes, porterhouse for 2, creamed spinach and asparagus.  Wonderful experience"
03/01/2017,Clocker,5.0,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our recent dining experience at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse at Mohegan Sun. Our waiter was personable and attentive to our needs, and our martinis were perfectly prepared. We ordered the special garlic bread with the wonderful dipping sauce as an appetizer and we shared the porterhouse steak for two that was delicious. The side of Brussel sprouts was also very tasty. We have been to Michael Jordan's on numerous occasions and we have never been disappointed!"
03/01/2017,WillD,5.0,Date night with wife
02/27/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Service was amazing. The steak was cooked perfectly, and topped with a delicious truffle crust recommended by our server! Wonderful experience!"

02/27/2017,nami,5.0,"Birthday  dinner 
Love the filets
Mash potato medley is terrific
Great wine

What could be better"
02/26/2017,DanaL,5.0,Anniversary
02/25/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Steaks were very high quality. Get the porterhouse for two! All the apps we got were delicious oysters, garlic bread, tuna tartar and the lobster dumplings all worth trying. Wedge salad was also great!"
02/25/2017,OpenTable Diner,3.0,The service was great. But I was disappointed with the food quality overall. Especially at that price. We had a half bottle of Santa Margherita Pinot Grigio that I believe was soured. My own fault for not sending it back. The cocktails we're not that good. Although when the waitress noticed that my wife was not drinking one she gave her a new one. The creamed spinach was delicious. The mashed potatoes were good but lukewarm when served. The signature Delmonico steak was very good. The price point of this restaurant is very high so I expect superior food quality and I don't believe I got that.
02/25/2017,HollyT,4.0,"Great service. High expectations for big prices, mostly worth it. Lobster dumplings too crunchy to fully enjoy; can't really tell you're eating lobster, either. Husband's steak was cooked medium rare instead of medium. We didn't complain, though. Steak was still tasty. Crab cake, bacon app, Caesar salad, potatoes all great."
02/25/2017,DarlaC,3.0,"We enjoyed our dinner very much. Everything was delicious. However, we had just gotten our menus in hand, and our server asked us if we would like some garlic bread.  My husband and I did not realize this was an appetizer, as we had not had a chance to look at our menus. She never mentioned it was an appetizer, so said yes, assuming the bread was a staple, like ice water.  When she left, it was then that we noticed  the bread was, indeed, an appetizer and cost $10.  I have no issue with the price. My complaint is that, although it was tasty,  I would not have chosen the garlic bread as my appetizer; I was looking at the Lobster Dumplings, with cost $4 more. Since we had the bread, another appetizer would have been too much food before dinner, so I passed.  I suggest that your servers be more forthright,  and give their guests a chance to settle in before recommending an item from the menu."
02/25/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great dining experience.  My steak was excellent and the lobster tails were big.
02/25/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,The steak was excellent ( Aged Kansas City Bone in Strip) the baked potatoes was pretty good and the Brussel sprout petals were good. The Garlic Bread was outstanding. The price is up there. It is definitely not a value meal.
02/25/2017,Meatlover,5.0,The staff was incredibly nice and very professional. The food was excellent. They gave us a very nice table in the back where it was quiet. I will go back again next time I'm at Mohegan Sun
02/24/2017,CarolB,5.0,We had wonderful service and food. The staff was very attentive. Can't wait to return.
02/24/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Food and service was excellent! I had the porterhouse for two, highly recommend.  The steak was cooked to perfection"
02/23/2017,KenB,5.0,"Always happy at MJ's. great service, great steak and a big fan of the grilled corn side."
02/22/2017,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"They tout the Delmonico as the house specialty, so I ordered it. However, there is absolutely nothing special about that steak. The inside was cooked as ordered, but the outside was a little too burnt. Our table ordered several different side dishes, but none stood out, and all were rather modest portions for the price.  On the recommendation of my waiter, I tried the baked Alaska. Again, it was fair, but a little too sweet and certainly nothing special."
02/21/2017,Bailey,5.0,Food was fantastic. One of the best steaks I ever had.sides were equally as good. 23 layer choclatiers cake was exceptional. Can't  wait to go back. Service was impeccable.
02/20/2017,DebM,4.0,"Food was was great especially the garlic bread fondue appetizer. However, when you are eating at a restaurant of this caliber the staff should not be spraying cleaner and vacumming at the next table during business hours!!"
02/20/2017,JulieF,1.0,Terrible food that is not made fresh. This is a shame as it used to be a good restaurant. They are charging Capital Grill prices and you can get a much better meal at an Outback Steakhouse. Total ripoff. We will never go back.
02/20/2017,RickK,3.0,Had to wait for a table even with a reservation. Was done with dinner before drinks were refilled. Food was excellent but pricey. Ruth Chris prices but not the same service. Enjoyable ambience.
02/19/2017,LindaN,5.0,We thoroughly enjoyed our experience at the steakhouse. Food was fabulous and the service was excellent. We certainly go again.
02/18/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Food and service was excellent.  The cost is pricey however
02/18/2017,GG84,5.0,"Food was tasty and fresh.  Service was also very attentive. Had a great experience. It is pricey, though"
02/18/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Wonderful spot for special occasions, or if you're looking for an incredible steak. Our Waiter was nervous, but very professional and had a great attitude. This is a 1.5 hour drive from our house but always worth the drive, and I always make my reservation in the car on the way. This time I made the reservation for 9:15pm and called that we were running late by 5 minutes. The hostess was extremely understanding and honest and said take your time your table wont be ready for another 10 minutes."
02/18/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Excellent service, excellent food, can get a little pricey with drinks.
Would definitely return"
02/18/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,This is my second time dining at MJ. And my steak is always cooked perfectly. The side dishes are huge. Easily can share them and still have leftover to take home.
02/18/2017,douglasdale,5.0,Fantastic as always. You just can't go wrong here.
02/18/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Wait staff super , I love the filet mignon , it just melts in your mouth. Never had a bad meal here. Everyone is a professional.  The noise level is a little high. However I over look it because of all the pluses!!"
02/17/2017,JoeU,4.0,Excellent meal. Jessie our server was very knowledgeable with the product as well as the wine list. I would only do one thing more. I would lightly dress the plate with something like parsley or a thickened au jour. plates looked blah when they hit the table. But steak was excellent
02/17/2017,Malugem,5.0,"Service and staff are very friendly and attentive . Food was delicious , portion sizes are huge . Ordered the rib eye and trio mashed potatoes which were delicious"

02/15/2017,SusanM,5.0,"We had an awesome dinner and our waiter was in-tuned with our needs even though it was extremely busy. We had great seating away from the front of the restaurant and no one rushed us through anything.

We will be back!"
02/15/2017,Rocky,5.0,"second time there and it was excellent as it was the first time, food, service and just a great overall dining experience."
02/15/2017,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"Apps were very good. My steak was cooked perfect but my wife's dish was pure salt. 

The desserts were horrendous. Chocolate cake crumbled as if it were old and stale, and cheesecake tasted just plain weird. 

Overall very disappointing."
02/14/2017,FranR,5.0,Had dinner on Valentine's Day.  This is our second time at MJ and food and service were  excellent both times.
02/14/2017,JOHNM,5.0,"Overall, great, enjoyable experience.   I intend t to return soon."
02/14/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Excellent meal. Pricey, but you get what you pay for. 
Sides are excellent!"
02/13/2017,saraho,3.0,"I was unfortunately dissatisfied with my overall experience... & I'm not usually very hard to please. There were tons of seating options available, but for some reason we were placed at an awkward, small table. My chair was so close to the man behind me, we had to move the table ourselves with the hostess watching & I was wearing a short skirt. My husbands chair was sticking out behind the wall, in the middle of restaurant foot traffic. I felt as though we should have been moved somewhere a little less... awkward & difficult. The drinks were good. The garlic bread app w/ blue cheese fondue was excellent. Meatballs... I could have done without. I had a chopped salad - meh. He had the filet which was decent. We got the Mac and cheese which I barely ate and I usually DEVOUR that anywhere. It tasted very... aged. I'm not sure what the problem was. The wait staff was great. Lighting & overall atmosphere was nice. But I'm truly sad to say that the food and how we were seated was very unimpressive."
02/12/2017,MaureenF,5.0,"Excellent porterhouse for two! Perfectly cooked and delicious! Great service by Jules! And as everyone says, don't miss the garlic bread.  We will return."
02/12/2017,ST18,4.0,"The food was incredible and so was the ambiance! The only suggestion would be to have the waiter or waitress inform  guests that the main course lacks a side dish. On a side note, one particular table of patrons were a little rowdy and using profanities quite frequently, but i guess this happens at a casino on a Saturday night. Luckily we were in a booth, which was away from the chaos, but we felt badly for the patrons seated at the table next to them. Overall a great experience though!"
02/12/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food at Michael Jordan steakhouse was amazing. I ordered the filet mignon and it was one of the best steaks I've ever had. The lobster dumplings and crab cakes were also amazing.
02/11/2017,kath,5.0,"It was crowded  and noisy, food delicious but expensive"
02/11/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Our meal was DELICIOUS the mood there was VERY pleasurable.  Our wait staff whose name is Chris was GREAT...EVERYONE there we met was GREAT...peaceful atmosphere relaxing and COMFORTABLE.. ANYONE looking for a great meal SHOULD give you a shot, i don't think they would regret it"
02/11/2017,Hav2eat,5.0,"Per usual everything we had was phenomenal, if you've never tried their blue cheese fondue garlic bread it is a must!!!"
02/10/2017,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Very unimpressive meal for the money. Nothing wrong with the food, but at $100+/pp with one drink each, I was expecting a better cut of beef and side dishes.  That said, the service staff was excellent."
02/06/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Took my wife out to celebrate her birthday at our favorite restaurant. That night falls right on supper bowls Sunday. Thought that it didn't matter cause it's Michael Jordan. But we were wrong. The service was always outstanding but the food that night was unexceptable,for the price we are paying for we expect nothing but the best. We ask the steak to medium well and when it came out it was well done. And one of our side is asparagus, it looks like that they r too busy looking at the game that they had forgotten that they had customers food on the stove. We didn't complain at the time cause we just want to at least enjoy our evening, so we try to eat what we can. I just want whoever is in charge and manage Michael Jordan at the time to look into this. We will probably go back and give it another chance but never again on a game night!"
02/05/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Overall I find that MJ's is always wonderful -- the service and all who work at this restaurant are 'a cut above' in the way they treat customers.  The food and the service is consistently outstanding.  It is by far my favorite restaurant at Mohegan Sun.
02/04/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Our server Brian was excellent. We had some allergies in the group and he was very accomadating.  He was also very attentive.  Great food. Totally worth the price
02/04/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"MJ's is a restaurant we always enjoy visiting.  The food is consistently excellent and the service is what one should expect from a higher end restaurant. The Rib-Eye was fantastic. No need to add steak sauce or even salt and pepper.  It was excellent from the first bite. The brussels sprouts were very good.  The mac/cheese side was average. The service was excellent and always is. In fact when I had mentioned my wife and I struggled on dessert choice because she doesn't eat chocolate but I do, the waiter comped us a chocolate desert on to go along with the Baked Alaska we had ordered.  We highly recommend MJ's for a great steak dinner."
02/03/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Anniversary
02/03/2017,Claven,5.0,"Great all-around place. Comparable to other good high-end steakhouses, it really is legit. Good whiskey and wine selection, knowledgeable servers, and awesome steaks."
02/01/2017,Al1228,5.0,"Great place with great food and service. My wife had the Lobster dumplings and thought they were delicious. I had the melt in your mouth Filet and she had the falling off the bone brisket.
Crème Brulee  was the perfect end to the meal!!"
01/29/2017,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"The experience at this steakhouse left me sorely disappointed given the cost of going there. Starting off despite having a reservation it took nearly 20 minutes to my table, never had this issue on OpenTable before. The weighting service was far below average in my opinion as well. The weighter took forever to come around to take our orders from the onset and rarely came back to the table after the food came. I will say the food met my expectations fully, but between waiting on the table and the bad service I doubt I will be going back."
01/29/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Everybody at Michael Jordan's was fantastic from our host and Hostess right down to Brian our server we had a great time it was a special occasion for  my girlfriend and i we are getting back together and they made it absolutely wonderful!!
01/29/2017,Cindyk,3.0,"For a top steak house very disappointing in steak.  Had much better elsewhere. Ordered the asparagus w/ marcona almond butter. Never expected to see a large ice cream scoop of butter topping the asparagus. All you could taste was butter. Oysters and bacon appetizers were excellent.
Server was excellent"
01/28/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Awesome as Always......The Delmonico is the best Steak Around!!!
01/27/2017,BostonEileen,5.0,The quality of the steaks are incredible!  Being able to customize them with add-ons like Truffle Parmesan crust makes a unique experience.
01/24/2017,KimberlyM,5.0,Our waiter and the staff in general was fantastic! The food was incredible.
01/22/2017,TOM14369,5.0,"I go there a lot when going to Mohegan Sun. The Garlic blue cheese bread you could make a meal of, the steaks are always spot on. I went with a friend who had never been before and he was real happy with his meal
Just remember it is a bit more pricey."
01/22/2017,JenniferC,4.0,"great time & great staff.  Loved the garlic bread, the porterhouse, creamed spinach and the mashed potato trio.  Could have passed on the lobster dumplings..."
01/22/2017,JOHNC,4.0,Food was very good however mac and cheese was too cheesy did not eat it.
01/21/2017,Justme,5.0,"Absolutely LOVED our dinner at Michael Jordan's Steak House - Mohegan Sun.  It was especially great because we had a top notch server.  Her name was Jennifer and she was absolutely outstanding.  We were seated about 20 minutes late for our 6:45 reservation because the restaurant was so busy.  She was such a delight that we forgot all about the delay.  She gave great recommendations for food, was happy and attentive.  She gets a 5 star rating from our table!  Thanks Jennifer for making our night so much fun!"
01/21/2017,Janette,5.0,I was at Mohegan sun and thanks to open table I was able to secure a reservation. Food is good a little pricey
01/21/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great restaurant.  Bacon app was amazing.  Steaks were deluscious.  Menu was expensive but we knew that before we went so that really didn't matter.  Filet was overcooked but management fixed right away and bought my drinks and gave us extra sides.  Defiantly make reservations because the line was crazy to get in if you didn't have anyour.  I loved it!
01/21/2017,dfood,4.0,"Overall I would say it's a nice place for a special occasion dinner, but expect to pay a hefty price.   The décor was very nice, but no white tablecloths, which frustrated the other couple we were with, lol.  Everyone in my party agreed that the crab cakes were delicious.  Someone in our party ordered scallops which were very undercooked.  Someone's filet mignon  was ordered medium and it was delivered well done, disappointing for an actual steakhouse (but he didn't want to complain).  And  I can never understand why these fancy steakhouses cannot at lease  put a dollup of a potato or a spoonful of a vegetable on the plate with a $49 fillet mignon."
01/20/2017,GlennR,3.0,"Had the Rib Eye and it was pretty fatty, especially for the price"
01/19/2017,Strombone,5.0,The Delmonico steak was fantastic.  My wife enjoyed the sea scallops.  The service was excellent. Thank you.
01/17/2017,EdwardW,3.0,"Been quite a few times and very satisfied.  Overall this trip not as inpressive.  Garlic bread was good but not what i have raved about.  Some of the bread was over cooked   There was no real garlic flavor.  The blue cheese was good as usual. 

Salads were good. Nothing real special just good. 

Steaks. Delmonico x 4. Mine was the best and since i did not really notice that the other 3 were so off till to late we did not send them back.  

The other 3 were  40 % fat. 

I understand it is a rich piece of meat.  But not 40% fat 

Btw steak sauce on the side I believe was described as a form of au jus.  It was  disgusting.  Even worse than a-1. If that is possible. 

Not sure how this happened. Hold you to a higher standard."
01/16/2017,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Did not like the french fries, they are so much better in NYC!
The fondue garlic bread was the best part of my meal. 
They had us sitting so close to another table you can hear every conversation!
For what you are paying I expect more.
The one in NYC is far better for every thing.
I would not go back to this restaurant"
01/15/2017,John,4.0,Was a little pricy for the amount you got. Could be a little less. The food was good but it didn't blow my mind especially with the prices you pay. atmosphere was excellent and the service was great.
01/15/2017,spappal15,5.0,"We generally love Michael Jordans  Steakhouse.  We always try to get reservation everything we go to see a show at Mohegan Sun. The atmosphere, staff and  food are to die for in my opinion."
01/15/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great food!! Great service!! Would definitely go back!
01/15/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellent food and service! I highly recommend eating there!

And ate family style. Wait staff was perfect"
01/10/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We were treated with great respect from the manager. She is a very good people person and am looking forward to return. This was a gift from our children as a Christmas gift.The food was excellent in presentation,taste ,and was cooked to our asking. The wait staff was helpfuf  since it was our first time ordering and made very helpful suggestions. In leaving I thanked the manager for a wonderful night and that we would return!"
01/06/2017,RobbinP,3.0,Food was excellent but overwhelming so big had to leave over half of it. Could not take home as we were staying overnight . Could not enjoy and talk as it was so loud
01/06/2017,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Delicious food, great atmosphere, good service, awesome place for any occasion"
01/03/2017,OpenTable Diner,3.0,A steakhouse that sent a raw steak to me for 56 bucks. Many better places in the casino and locally with dry aged meat that far surpass the quality here
01/03/2017,LouC,5.0,"Service was superb, very attentive staff that was there when they needed to be, but not in our way.   Everything was prepared exactly as ordered and delicious.  Price is a bit on the high side, but that is expected leaving this a great place for any special occasion."
01/02/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"A little pricy for a regular joe,but nice treat. I would to return."""
01/01/2017,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"Had dinner reservations for 5:15, was seated at 5:19. No problems there.  Appetizers was awesome then it was all downhill from there. The waitress nevertheless showed her face halfway through the appetizers never showed back up until 6:12 to inform us that the kitchen lost our ticket. Then asked if we wanted another appetizer after we ordered a 65.00 steak and a 24.00 dollar salt block chicken with sides. Who wants additional appetizers after ordering waguy meatballs and garlic bread. (It was only two of us) the meals were severed at 6:27. Steak was ordered med well, was delivered to the table rare with blood on the plate. Chicken bland an cold. The waitress asked if she could bring the steak back to the kitchen (really) after waiting an hour for food. Then we was asked to wait to speak to the manager. The manger should have showed up well before then ... I believe. This was the first steakhouse I have ever walked out on.  I often eat a capital grill or Ruth Chris. That's what I get for cheating on my favorite restaurants.  Hahaha. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO SAY THE LEAST."
01/01/2017,ARSNV2015,5.0,The Wagyu meatballs were delicious. My wife and I are never disappointed when we dine at Michael Jordan's Steskhouse.
01/01/2017,VickiK,5.0,"We had the most delicious Tomahawk steak and lamb chops that just melted in your mouth.  The Caesar Salad was fresh and crisp and flavorful as was the beet and goat cheese salad.  Overall a terrific meal.  We shared Baked Alaska between the 4 of us which was also excellent.  Our Server, whose name escapes me now was fabulous.  She knew when to come over and check on us to see if we needed anything and was very considerate and professional.  I wish I could remember her name.  :-("
01/01/2017,CHARLESV,3.0,"Steak was fine, sides were boring,  lacking flavor, and overpriced. I would not recommend this eatery."
01/01/2017,Eric,5.0,Very nice ambience with great food.  The Lamb Chops were out of this world with great tasting crispy bones.  The corn was fabulous; it was pulled off the cob and was cooked to perfection.  Even the garlic bread was amazing. I tasted a scallop and that was great as well.  The price is very high but given the class of restaurant was well worth it to go there as a special treat.  I'll be back there again.
01/01/2017,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"New Year's Eve dinner, good food but very noisy"
01/01/2017,bigpenguin,4.0,Expensive.  Excellent friendly service. The steak was prepared correctly and flavorful.  The lobster was overcooked and tough.
12/31/2016,majormelvin,4.0,"We went here New Years Eve.    We ended up getting an early reservation.   The food was delicious, the atmosphere great.   It was in Mohegan Sun and they were doing sound checks for the New Years Eve gala right outside.  The place was shaking with the music, but other than that... it was a great night. We would go again."

12/30/2016,PAULY70,4.0,FOOD AND SERVICE WERE VERY GOOD. I WISH IT WASN'T SO EXPENSIVE OTHERWISE I WOULD BE GOING MORE OFTEN
12/29/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Consistent every visit here. Superior service and quality food.
12/28/2016,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Mahhhhhhjjjjjjjh
12/26/2016,MelissaJ,3.0,The hostess was very helpful and friendly.  She was able to seat us earlier than our reservation time. Overall the staff was nice. The food was mediocre at best.  Do not see ourselves going back - Very pricey- not worth it .
12/25/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Food was delicious great atmosphere would recommend for steak
12/24/2016,GaryS,3.0,"All around excellent except seating was a insulting. There were many central tables available yet hostess said they were being saved for others and we were placed in cramped corner. When we asked to move we were politely told no sorry not possible. Not a single one of the ""reserved"" tables were ever occupied and sat vacant. Insulting."
12/22/2016,DaveJag,5.0,I went here a few ago and the food was absolutely great and scenery was perfect. I loved the wings they gave me and the service provider of them was quite friendly. I would definitely come back here when I'm around the area again.
12/22/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food and wait staff was excellent.  We were staying the night so had a frig delivered to our room for the left overs.
12/21/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellent food and service at a very reasonable price
12/17/2016,CharlesL,5.0,The food was great the price was a little high but will worth it
12/17/2016,MattP,5.0,Amazing food. Steak was the best I ever had. A little pricey but worth it. Service was great as well.
12/17/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,This was a great place to celebrate my husbands birthday.  We had a wonderful time and the food was delicious.
12/16/2016,tuscanyfan,5.0,"This is our go to restaurant when ever we go to Mohegan Sun, which we do often.
the garlic bread is outstanding, the steak is the best i have ever had, and the baked potato is almost a meal itself.
the wait staff is attentive to our needs and very pleasant.

Certainly on the pricey side, but worth it."
12/16/2016,Capone,2.0,"Been gong to this restaurant several times a year since it opened. Usually very good food, this time only fair. Seems to be slipping for about two years"
12/15/2016,RHCT,4.0,It was good but far too overpriced for what you get. My steak was tough and a $60 steak should not be tough. Especially a $60 Delmonico aged 45 days. I'm not one to waste food so I ate it but I will just never be here again.
12/12/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great experience. The porterhouse for 2 was right on the money. The creamed spinach by far the best I've ever tasted. 5 stars for me. Our waitress was great.
12/12/2016,Clocker,5.0,"My wife and I had a wonderful dining experience at Michael Jordan's Steak House at Mohegan Sun this week. The martinis were perfect and our porterhouse steak for two was delicious and perfectly prepared.  The cheesy garlic bread was a tasty appetizer, and the service was friendly and attentive to our needs. We were much too full to have dessert. We really enjoyed dining at Michael Jordan's at Mohegan Sun and will definitely return in the future."
12/12/2016,Mitch,5.0,"Excellent service and while the food, my particular steak - in my opinion, was not as good as the last time, I still think this is a great place and would come back again.
Everybody from the hostess to the manager to the wait staff were super friendly, courteous and very professional. 
The wait staff was very knowledgeable in all the items on the menu including the bar menu.
Can't wait to return."

12/11/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Because of the excellent service and great tasting dishes, we always consider MJ's for our special occasions. We have been coming here for many years and are always pleased with the service from the staff, food quality,  and wine list. This time was no different. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves from start to finish!"
12/10/2016,Rich,5.0,very busy night. front of house handled it perfectly. our reservation time was to a tee. had some celebrities dining in dining room  Adam Sandler and all his comedian friends. food was very good. service also on call with probably 3 people handling our every needs. just lost in casino. oh well
12/10/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Best Staff, Very Friendly, Awesome Bartenders Make The Night Lots Of Fun!! Food Is Always The Best!!"
12/10/2016,Elyse,5.0,Went to see a show at the Arena and was pleasantly surprised with Michael Jordan's Steakhouse. The filet mignon was amazing as was the tiramisu. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone!
12/10/2016,ErinN,5.0,"We recently visited Mohegan Sun and had dinner at Michael Jordan steakhouse.  The waiter was wonderful, he explained the different types of steaks and was extremely friendly.  The food was amazing.  The steak was perfectly cooked, sides were just the right size to share.  Would definitely come back again for a special occasion."
12/09/2016,MargaretG,5.0,The food is always so delicious. Every bite is heaven. We never have been disappointed. We've taken guests there for dinner and everyone is always very impressed with the food.
12/06/2016,Winecountrydpt,5.0,"Everytime we go here the service and the food are absolutely amazing and top-notch. Servers are very professional and attentive. Nightly some kind of amazing special on the menu for the night. The last time we went, even though we did not get this was a 50 day aged Tomahawk ribeye which was enough for two to split however $125. Just a big note to be aware of all menu items ala carte so if you would like an additional side it is going to cost you money because it is not included. On the plus side though all of these sides are large enough for two people to split. We have always been so full after we finish our amazing meals there that we have never been able to order off the dessert menu what all items do sound delicious.  They have an extensive wine menu which the servers are knowledgeable of and can help you pick a perfect wine to pair with your meal. No this is never happen to us, celebrities often frequent this restaurant but we have never been fortunate enough to been there on a weekend when a celebrity is in town. You do have the option of bottled water, tap water, or sparkling water. Do be aware if you get the bottled water it does cost you somewhere between 7 and $9 which they do not tell you upfront. Be prepared to spend quite a bit of money at this restaurant even for two people. Our last bill with one bottle of wine and two dinners with one side was $227. It is absolutely well worth the price however if you are staying in a hotel please ensure that you have a refrigerator to place your leftovers in because what a waste that would be if you spent that much money on such a wonderful meal and could Salvage your leftovers. We will continue to go to this restaurant every single trip that we have to the casino we just can't pass up the opportunity. The price is well worth it."
12/04/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The entire dining experience was perfect.  The food (mine - tuna, my husband - petite filet) was delicious, including the signature bread and the caesar salad.  Service was attentive but not over bearing.  Definitely a great place for a celebration"
12/04/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We had a wonderful time! It was a lovely surprise for my boyfriend's birthday! The dining and service were exquisite!
12/03/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,I liked everything and more then michael jordan is My favorite player
12/02/2016,IncredibleEats,5.0,"Jordan's steak house is not the ""hey, let's grab dinner out"" kind of place, unless you regularly pay a couple hundred dollars per couple for dinner... this is the special, anniversary, birthday, holiday gift, special date, death row last meal kind of place... though you will pay significantly more than the franchised steak places with the fried onion appetizer and the kitschy décor, the food is on a level that cannot compare... when you look up the gastronomic definition of steak, this is the place they go to for the example... the presentation was magazine photo worthy. I started to drool pre-emptively as the plate was put on the table in front of me. As I placed the first bite into my  mouth, every cell in my body screeched to a grinding halt to say, ""WHAT WAS THAT?"" and ""PLEASE DO THAT AGAIN!""... I've eaten many a herd of cattle's worth of steak in my time, from many places that claim carnivorous greatness... up until now, I feel like I didn't know what steak really could taste like. the texture was somewhere between a soft tender kiss on the lips and a full body hug by your favorite lover. I struggle to really describe it in food terms, as it was so much more than anything I've put in my  mouth. though the a la cart sides seem a bit daunting to choose from, I get the feeling that there is no bad choice. the baked potato was the size of an NBA sneaker, but tasted like a mouth full of sweet childhood dreams, exuding crème fresh and bacon. even the skin, often left like a bad tie on the plate, was crispy and delicious and was eaten without even needing the usual ""it's good for you"" prodding"". the Brussels sprouts were so good that it seemed insulting to even call them Brussels sprouts. They should have been called ""Just put these in your mouth and thank us later"".  Even the ""house bread"" deserved so much more respect (we don't recall who ate the first basket placed at our table within 5 minutes of arrive, so we needed to order another). Overall, I give it 10 stars."
12/02/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Nice ambience along with great service. Great food served fast and well prepared. Disappointed that our server ""Mike"" was actually not Michael Jordan."
12/02/2016,EllenA,5.0,Great dining experience! Our server Chris k was awesome

11/26/2016,Kylesprof,5.0,"Excellent dinner! We enjoyed the seafood tower (awesome), filet minion with two of the crusts (DH and I each had a filet), asparagus, creme brûlée, and some delicious wine. Loved everything! Can't wait to go back. Expensive ($350) but not overpriced - we got what we paid for- very good. The steak, seafood, and wine were the highlights."
11/26/2016,TracyA,5.0,Fantastic meal and dining experience.  We had 8 in our party and everyone was thrilled with their meals.  A+ customer service

11/25/2016,kmack,5.0,Food and service were terrific. A little bit pricey but a great dining experience.
11/25/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Great steak.  I had the small filet  in and it was perfect.

11/20/2016,JimCEO,5.0,This place is a true gem...although this time we sat at a table and the service was exceptional we usually frequent the bar...the waitstaff and barstaff are both friendly and knowledgable and the food is great. Can't say enough good things about the place...
11/19/2016,Stelair,4.0,Came to Michael Jordon's after a Basket ball game.  Service was excellent.  Loved the bacon appetizer.  Risotto undercooked but scallops delicious.  Delmonico steak  suburb.  Fries an bit wimpy.   The chocolate tart for desert was excellent.  Overall a great night.
11/19/2016,Foodie,5.0,Excellent food!
11/19/2016,JenniferB,4.0,"Steak was delicious, as it should be for $50 A la carte.  Mashed potatoes were mediocre for an additional $14. We did not pay for salads.  The waitstaff was friendly and very hard working as it was a super busy night. We waited about 15 minutes for our drinks, but they were good.  The steak was really the highlight of the night however I'm just not sure it was worth $50."
11/18/2016,SusanB,5.0,Food was beyond excellent. The service was amazing!  Loved the atmosphere! Can't wait to go back!!
11/17/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food and service was fantastic but the layer cake we brought home was disappointing. We were celebrating my birthday and to see myself and other people get the little cupcake was not very exciting .
11/15/2016,matnag01,5.0,"From the time we walked in to the time we left the experience was amazing.  This is a gem at Mohegan and if you love steak, seafood and wine you will not be disappointed."
11/13/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great food and wonderful service.  We celebrated our birthday's.  The Delmonico was excellent and the Filet Mignon was excellent too.  Make sure you try the bacon appetizer!!
11/13/2016,Kath,5.0,The filet was cooked to perfection.  And the service was exceptional! Definitely will return.
11/13/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"I live in New York City and I’ve been to some of the best steakhouses in the five boroughs. Michael Jordan’s Steak House at Mohegan Sun is consistently the best steak that I ever get to eat. The food overall is fantastic, I’ve never had a bad meal here. The sides and apps are delicious, and the seafood towers are fresh and flavorful. I’ve been going to Jordan’s for almost ten years and it never disappoints. Years ago I had an Ossobucco that was incredible, and recently my wife and I had the bone-in Filet with Lobster Tail and it was extraordinary. Great food, nice wine list, a little loud, but always a great time. Thank You, Jordan’s. I’d rather give my money to you instead of the blackjack tables any day of the week."
11/13/2016,ALICIAB,3.0,I was disappointed that after we walked out the waitress Chase to stone to let us know we can use our food coupon when we were told we could. So we had to dish out another $50. Usually Service is a little better than it was but overall the food was good but don't think I'll be going back there for a while.
11/12/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Great food and service! It was very noisy, difficult to have a conversation."

11/12/2016,slick,2.0,very noisy. Delmonico steak [their signature item] was fatty with lots of gristle.
11/12/2016,Ballo,4.0,The Delmonico steak at Jordan's ranges between eh and the best steak I've ever eaten. This one was eh.
11/11/2016,JeanneM,3.0,"Excellent food and service , however the ac ( nov 11, 2016) was blowing on our table so badly I asked twice please turn it down , no response from management ,  it actually made our food cold ...so we ate fast to enjoy our food before it got cold ... Couldn't stay for dessert because we were  freezing..."
11/11/2016,Susan4,5.0,"I've been to MJs quite a few times and it never disappoints. The food is always delicious, and the staff are friendly and fantastic. Thank you."
11/10/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Fantastic, highly recommended.   Great wine list.   Steaks outstanding.   Had bone in  ribeye and  a bone in filet mignon special with  scallops.   Corn was amazing.   Seriously."
11/08/2016,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"I ordered the petite filet mignon-it was the best steak I have ever eaten- cooked just perfect, tender and delicious. The mashed potatoes were average in taste and the fries swimming in the truffle oil (not tasty at all). Our server was outstanding and the overall experience was great."
11/08/2016,Barney,5.0,I visits Michael Jordan's 3/4 times this year the steak is wonderful as is the service.
11/07/2016,Sy804,4.0,The steak was very good. I didn't care for the mac n cheese but the steak was a plus for me. I would recommend this for anyone looking to take someone on a romantic date. The lights are dim and it sets a great mood. The overall experience was good to me.
11/06/2016,LB81,2.0,Love the food but asked for ribeye medium well and it was completely burnt. Has happened before as well. Experience was kind of ruined. Everything else was delicious.
11/06/2016,lalafrance,5.0,Had the porterhouse for 2.  Cooked to perfection!  Garlic bread/ dip was to die for!

11/06/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We were seated right away for our 7:15 reservation.  Our waitress knew the menu and was able to help me pair a wine with my meal.  The Grey Goose dirty martini was excellent.  Our steaks were cooked perfect.  Overall, it was a good night!"

11/05/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Food was great! Ordered the mussels and tuna tartar to start which were both excellent! The bread is served nice and hot and fresh, soooo good!

11/05/2016,Katie,4.0,Server was great. Love the garlic bread   For the price think cocktails could be a little bigger. Wouldn't order scallops again but they were good. Would stick with steak.  Husbands steak was cooked very well; delicious .

11/02/2016,Vegas10years,5.0,We picked Michael Jordan's Steakhouse at Mohegan Sun for a dinner to celebrate an anniversary. This was our third visit and we were not disappointed. All of the starters (salads and soups) were tasty. The dinner rolls were served timely and warm. The wine list is extensive but not over the top. Three of us had steaks that were perfectly grilled to order. Two sides (fries and creamed spinach) were more than enough to share for 4 diners. We finished the meal with the chocolate tart to share all around. Kudos to Bryan and Jorge for great service.
11/01/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,The tuna tartare was amazing! Seafood was amazingly fresh!
10/31/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Had dinner to celebrate mine and my wife's birthday.    Service was top notch.   Food was outstanding and it was a lovely restaurant to choose.
10/30/2016,DavidR,4.0,Boys night at casino. MJ's was as expected - nice steak prepared well. Good cocktails and wine. Service was above par. Best of breed at Mohegan Sun.
10/29/2016,BillV,4.0,"We enjoyed our dining experience. Overall very good from the wine to the garlic bread appetizer to the great porterhouse steak. Good wine selection too. We have been there before and we will be back,hopefully soon. Only downer is its almost a two hour drive to get there."
10/29/2016,LisaK,5.0,"The food was amazing, the staff was quick, efficient and friendly. The noise level is much higher in the front of the restaurant than in the back. If on a date or there for a special occasion make a reservation for a table in the back. My husband and I were there to celebrate our 20th anniversary and our quite booth in the back was perfect. Loved it and will definitely go there again."
10/29/2016,AUGUSTUSC,4.0,It was fine. Not spectacular but generally good.
10/29/2016,DAVIDF,5.0,My wife and I have been coming here for the past 11 years at least 3 or 4 times each year and even had out wedding reception here.  The food and service are superb.
10/29/2016,GlennR,5.0,"Wife and daughter had tix to Carrie Underwood the night before at casino. My son and I met them the next day and we all had dinner at Michael Jordan's. 
Food was great. Service was great."
10/28/2016,J05A,5.0,"The garlic bread appetizer is the best $10 you will ever spend on an appetizer.  The only thing that could have made it better is if the bread had been cut into quarters instead of halves.  My girlfriend and I had a Kansas City, cooked medium, and it was delicious.  The creamed spinach and macaroni & cheese sides were also tasty.  The creme brulee was excellent.  The whole experience was great."
10/28/2016,DCSC,5.0,"We always have a good time at Michael Jordan's Steak House, it is our go to place at Mohegan Sun.  Our food & service were both up to the standards we are used to when dining there."
10/28/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Food is excellent!  It is on the pricy side but worth it.  Service was a little slow
10/28/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Outstanding experience.
10/27/2016,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"service poor, food not cooked as ordered,ambiance ok,"
10/27/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Everything was great as usual.  Loved the garlic bread fondue.  We always get the ribeye and for this particular visit, it was thicker than usual, a little on the tough side, and kind of under marinated.  It was still good just not as good as the last.  We will definitely be back when we go to Mohegan Sun. Our fave restaurant."
10/25/2016,CaptEZ,5.0,"Sorry to see the Steak Tartare off the menu...The Tuna Tartare was very good but the chips tooo salty.
Porterhouse was terrific as usual & the Salmon was done perfectly."
10/23/2016,Sher,2.0,"Have been to MJ numerous times , as it is a spot that works when Im doing a concert.  However it is a hit or miss, sometimes the food is better then others , more then not it is a disappointment, would really wish they could step it up and make this a five star , I would have to say its more like a 1 star. For the prices they get you would think a 50.00 steak would not be over cooked!"
10/23/2016,Dede,5.0,Had a great meal before the show.  Highly recommend this restaurant.
10/23/2016,OpenTable Diner,3.0,over rated...very noisy and dark not fine dining.  Steak was quite tough
10/23/2016,JoyC,5.0,"They were so accommodating at this restaurant.  I had made reservations the previous week for 6:15pm, in the meantime my husband had surprised me with tickets to the show at Mohegan for that evening at 7:30pm. We arrived early for our reservation explaining about the tickets, they seated us immediately at 5:30, we were thrilled.  The service was impeccable, the food superb.  My only negative would have been the noise level, pretty busy, therefore very noisy."
10/23/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The delmonico steak is superb and they pretty much always cook the steaks exactly to the requested doneness..... Unlike many other steakhouses
10/22/2016,MJ26,4.0,"My husband and I ate here last weekend. I had requested a table not too close to another table in advance, and they honored that request. We had a table off to the side that was very roomy and private. It was towards the back of the restaurant which was considerably less noisy than the front. My husband ordered oysters for an appetizer which he said tasted good(more about that later) and I ordered shrimp cocktail which was just okay. It didn't have much taste and was chewy/gamey. We both ordered steak (Del Monica and Petite Sirloin) which we thought were outstanding. We shared the creamed spinach which I did not care for at all; too much cream not the right flavor, and not enough spinach. Our waitress, Melissa, was exceptional and attentive which made up for the aforementioned shortcomings. The Malbec was decent; my husband's Martini was average at best. My husband had an excellent Martini at Bar American prior to this dinner; the Martini here paled in comparison. Overall, a very nice dinner thanks to the waitress, table and amazing steaks. *Later that night, my husband became ill and was in the bathroom all night. We suspect it was the oysters, however, in all fairness to the restaurant, this has happened to my husband twice before. Either oysters don't agree with him, or he's had bad luck 3/5 that he's eaten them. No more oysters for him!"
10/22/2016,Jeff,5.0,"Hi,
  I'd like to share my dinning experience and give my recommendation for this steakhouse.  I arrived with my wife at Michael Jordans Steakhouse and was greeted by a group of hostess that made us feel ""special"".  One of hostess escorted us to our table and presented us with a wine selection and explained our options for some specials that evening.  We ordered a bottle of champagne and opted for the rib eye for 2 with the ""3 mashed potato"".  All I can say is WOW.  I'm very critical when it comes to food especially paying a premium.  The ribeye was cooked perfectly and came cut in pieces presented on a platter with the bone the size of my arm.  What a presentation……really cool.  With regards to mash…..I suggest these.  The mashed potatoes had lobster pieces mixed in with potatoes & cheese…..really really good (actual pieces of lobster).  We enjoyed our dinner and felt special.  Our waiter somehow always knew when our glass of champagne was low because he'd mysteriously appear to fill our glass……we never touched the bottle ourselves!  He was also personable.  Lastly I'd like to talk about the General Manager Paul LaFluer.  I had a small detail that I wasn't happy with and it's not enough to even talk about in this review.  In conversation with Paul I mentioned  it and Paul went out of way to validate, empathize, apologize and rectify.  This was the most impressive part of the meal.  Something so small and he was so busy yet Paul stopped and focused on my wife and I making us feel we where the only 2 people in his restaurant.  When my wife and walked out to go to the show I looked at her and said ""I will be back just because of the way the manager made me feel""…..I felt like I mattered and that doesn't happen these days all to often in this industry.  Nice job to Michael Jordans Restaurant and a big thank you to Paul LaFluer…….you make a difference!  

Regards,
Jeff"
10/22/2016,TinaW,5.0,We had a wonderful experience. Julez was absolutely amazing her customer service was on point from beginning to end. The food was seasoned to perfection
10/20/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Great place to celebrate our best friends bachelor party. Well worth every penny we spent here, mainly due to our server Jules! She was the most knowledgeable and genuinely amazing server I have ever had. That night was the best dining experience of my life because of her!"
10/20/2016,JanD,2.0,"I last was there two years ago.  The food was excellent, food presentation was professional, service was great and at the level expected for the prices charged,  portions were ample and most if not all of the clientele was dressed for dining,  as opposed to eating.  The prices are always high but that is acceptable when everything else at a high level.

This time the food was excellent, food presentation was lacking, [three steaks were served basically on a plain white plate. The Kubota pork chop was served very professionally. The shrimp seemed a little dated. Why is baked Alaska on the menu when it is not served as baked Alaska should be. The flame presentation is half if not more of the reason to order it.  Frankly, I should have sent that back as it was not as advertised.   The service was ok, but not at the level it should be for the prices charged.    Plates for sharing appetizers  and the baked Alaska had to be repeatedly requested.  No service utensils were provided for the asparagus.  In prior years the family style vegetables could easily serve a party of four.  Now,  they are more appropriate for a party of two.   

A good portion of the clientele more appropriately dressed for the sports bar, as opposed to fine dining.   It seems that the restaurant has lowered its standards to the level of the least common denominator customer of the casino as opposed to serving a high end dining experience.

It was not the dining experience expected at a price of over $100/head for 4 people. [5 glasses of wine; 2 bottles of beer]"
10/20/2016,Kareness,4.0,"The appetizers were very good (I had the beets with goat cheese and pistachios...could have used a little more of the latter 2)...hubby had the shrimp cocktail. The rib steak was delicious, and cooked perfectly. They had onion rings many years ago,and we miss them."
10/18/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Always consistent steak house with large portions and great service!
The crab cake is a must try as it has little to no breading, great app."
10/16/2016,JudyD,4.0,"We had a reservation and were seated right away.  We ordered petite filet and shared one side.  We had water to drink and the bill was $117.  The steaks were wonderful  - cut like butter, but the price was outrageous.  I've always wanted to experience this restaurant, and now I have.  I probably won't return due to the cost.  But, if you have plenty of disposable income, try it out."
10/15/2016,ChristopherT,5.0,Amazing date spot with even more amazing food.
10/14/2016,MariaF,3.0,"We've dined here a few times in the past. The food is typically good & have never really had any complaints. I would point out that I felt the mac & cheese this time was not quite as good as it has been in the past. Besides that, rest of the food was good. Steaks were cooked exactly how my husband & I ordered them. The drinks were also good. We didn't have dessert this time around. We had a 6:15pm reservation because we were going to an 8pm show. The service was so SLOW that we had to rush out of there at 7:55pm. Even our drinks took forever. 

Would recommend more staff especially on event nights to ensure everyone is served in a timely manner."
10/14/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Steak was delicious but for the price?  A large plate with only a piece of meat not even a small side seemed exorbitant, sides were delivered a few minutes later...."
10/14/2016,ElanaS,5.0,It was our first time visiting Michael Jordan's we where celebrating my boyfriends birthday everyone was so nice very knowledgeable. Even the manger came to every table and asked how everything was. I would definitely go back again.
10/14/2016,Diana,5.0,Great service and food! Went to M. Jordan's to celebrate my husband's birthday. They seated us in a comfortable booth with ample seating which made the experience even better.
10/11/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We always dine here for special occasions and we are never disappointed. We love the delicious entrees and sides provided by the restaurant. We love the ambiance and also appreciate the attentive hostess and servers. If we request a booth, the staff will always deliver and make sure that we are comfortable. Everything is impeccable and that is why we always return. Thank you!!"
10/10/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Another amazing dinner at  Michael Jordan's.  Filet mignon was tender and delicious. Our waitress was smart and funny. Great evening overall.
10/09/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,The food was very good. The ribeye was cooked to perfection and was very tasty.  The service was sparse.  The noise gave me a headache.
10/08/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Wasn't too thrilled that a group of obnoxious people were seated before us even though we had a reservation and they did not. We got to watch them bribe the
10/08/2016,AMGC,4.0,Excellent steak; very good service but it is very noisy restaurant. Not really romantic.
10/08/2016,razorfacemadman,4.0,"The food was outstanding! The meatballs appetizer was delicious, my steak was perfectly cooked. Our waiter was great. He was attentive, but not overly so. He had great knowledge of the menu and was able to recommend several dishes for us."
10/07/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The night was amazing. Great seating for two, totally romantic ambiance. I was very relaxed, very pleased overall."
10/07/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Yummy steak, baked potatoes, mac n' cheese, garlic bread. 
Wonderful meal, did feel a little rushed but understandably so was a packed night."
10/07/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The food was delicious. Our server was excellent. I made a reservation on open table which was super easy. However, there were a significant amount of tables open because our reservation was early (4:40) and we were initially sat at a small table right near the server station. We had to ask for a table further away for a little more privacy and less noise. Our server was accommodating to the request.  Pricey but worth it for an occasional special night out."
10/07/2016,DaniM11,5.0,We had a wonderful experience. Our server was fantastic and made my moms birthday extra special. The food was absolutely incredibly seasoned and cooked perfectly. Thank you for a fantastic experience to begin our awesome night seeing Bruno Mars!!
10/03/2016,ChadE,5.0,MJs hands-down has the BEST Steak I've ever had.  Expensive but totally woth it's weight in gold.  The COWBOY is amazing.
10/02/2016,CesarSalad,5.0,Always a great experience.  This time the food was outrageous.  The fillet was superb.
10/01/2016,Marc,5.0,Was awesome just little noisy but fantastic and terrific service

10/01/2016,JFreel24,5.0,"Service, food, ambiance and setting were all top notch. Would highly recommend this steakhouse, will be back sometime soon."
10/01/2016,coastiedan,5.0,I've here few times. The garlic bread/ blue cheese fondue are to die for. Great night.
09/30/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,There isn't ANYTHING that isn't wonderful!!
09/26/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Had another wonderful meal at Michael Jordan's.  The steaks were perfect and done exactly as requested.  The crabcake and Waygu meatballs appetizers were excellent!  Our server Julie went out of her way to make sure everything was wonderful including finding fresh strawberries to bring for dessert when we asked if there they had anything with berries.
09/24/2016,RussellP,3.0,"My wife and I made reservations at Michael Jordan steakhouse for her birthday dinner. I had been told by one of the person that it was comparable to Morton's steakhouse.

We were very disappointed some of the food.  

 The blue cheese  fondue was excellent. 

 My wife's filet mignon was great as well. 

 However, the Del Monaco steak which is a Jordan's signature steak had equally amount of fat as it did meat. 

 The creamed spinach did not meet expectations either.    We couldn't tell if the spinach was undercooked, or frozen. It just didn't taste very good. 

 We also got the Jordan's signature mashed trio.    Again, did not come close to expectations. 

 For the price of the items on the menu, I expected the quality to rival that of the capital Grille, Del Frisco's, Ruth's Chris, Fleming's, etc. 

However it did not"
09/24/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Food was good but expensive. Everything was a la cart. Didn't care for the fact that you had to pass through casino full of smoke to get there. The restaurant was non smoking but by the time we left our clothes smelled!
09/24/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We booked this as part of celebrating our 20 year wedding anniversary and loved it. Could. It have asked for a more pleasant and catering staff or overall ambiance!!!
09/24/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Great service , side dishes creative and tasty. The petite filet mignon was good, but you can get one just as good at Texas Roadhouse that's less expensive."
09/24/2016,LizeR,2.0,"I was excited to visit this place for the first time on my birthday. I'd seen the menu online so I knew what to expect in terms of price. I just didn't expect the steaks to not include any kind of sides, you just get the meat you order plain on a plate, not even a garnish. I ordered a Sangria and the waitress forgot about it, had to remind her about it and it was still a while before she brought it. Otherwise, the Prime New York Strip steak was delicious. We added the macaroni and cheese as a side and it was good. The complementary birthday dessert I received was ok. Overall, I think there are better options at Mohegan Sun to have your birthday dinner and/or celebrate a special occasion. Also, other places may have a friendlier atmosphere than here."
09/23/2016,Goodfood4you,5.0,Everything is perfect from beginning to end. The food is portioned perfectly and the drinks are fantastic and more importantly consistent! This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to when I'm in the area. You get what you pay for.
09/21/2016,AudraD,4.0,"Not as good as I remember it being a few years ago. Bone-in sirloin was very chewy - for the price should have been melting in our mouths. My steak was ordered medium and when I cut into it, it was raw inside. They took it back to cook it more but I think they must have tried to cook it too quickly and it ended up charred a bit, which I don't like. Only up side was the steak was thick enough that I could cut a piece and trim off the crispy edges. Side dishes are not a great assortment if you don't like smoked flavoring - half of the sides have some sort of smoked aspect to it which really limited my options. The noise level was really high - felt more like a tavern than a steakhouse. The best part of the night was the service - waitress was very friendly and very knowledgeable.  With so many negatives I don't see us returning any time soon."
09/20/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Our meal was excellent as always and our waiter Rob is the best, as we ask for him everytime we're there."
09/18/2016,lba315,5.0,"My wife and I have been blessed enough to be able to frequent many a steakhouse whenever an occasion needs to be celebrated, and we've hit some fabulous ones throughout the years. But somehow we've never hit any of the Michael Jordan steakhouses. So on the occasion of my wife Donna's birthday, staying at Mohegan Sun, she decided this was where she wanted to have her birthday dinner. Great choice!

 I had reserved on Open Table, sending the restaurant a heads-up that today was Donna's birthday and to please provide a memorable experience for her. Boy did they deliver! First, she was given a birthday card just as we were seated. Our servers Ryan and Kaitlynne were so ""on point"" all night. If a glass needed refilling, Kaitlynne was all over it without being asked. Ryan's personable, attention to detail was beyond reproach. They were terrific!

 As for the meal itself, SUPERB!! Donna ordered the burrata and tomato salad, I chose the iceberg wedge salad with blue cheese dressing. Both were wonderful! Our encrusted filet mignons (Donna's in blue cheese, mine in Parmesan) complete with creamed spinach and barley pilaf were culinary perfection. But the best was yet to come!

 The ""birthday girl"" ordered a rich, decadent chocolate torte with Irish coffee, while I had the restaurant's Boston Cream Pie with a ""Nutty Irishman"" coffee. Tall, round, oh so great, with a presentation that was even better! My pie came out sans chocolate, until our server Ryan poured a chocolate ganache over the tasty morsel. Previously, Ryan and Kaitlynne presented Donna with a birthday cupcake to celebrate her birthday. They made her feel like a queen!

 Casino restaurants usually don't offer a great experience. They usually want to get you in and out quickly, which rushes the experience. Tonight on the other hand, was very special!"
09/18/2016,LovesGoodFood,4.0,"Very loud. A few tables of larger groups. If you go to dinner for two, ask for a quiet location. Food was top notch. My salad didnt come on time. They removed it from the bill. Steak was phenominal as was the seared scallops with ""pork cotton""."
09/17/2016,BillCT,4.0,Great food. Excellent steak. Way too noisy. Not a place for quiet conversation.
09/17/2016,StecenS,4.0,"Service, atmosphere and food quality is very good. It is a bit expensive however for what u get. 7oz filet $39 with no side included is pricey. I ordered a lobster tail as an add on to my steak($19). When it came out a almost told the waitress to take it back. Was the smallest lobster tail I have ever seen. Looked like a large shrimp. It was delicious but literally 2 bites.  Drinks were about $13 each. Overall great food but could be a little less $. Dinner was $210 for 2 of us( no tip incl.) The steaks were excellant & waitress was great."
09/17/2016,Tasty,3.0,"Very disappointed, my husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and we barely conversed with each other due to the noise level. Not worth the money steak had no flavor. Not many sides  to choose from if your not  a cheese or seafood lover. My husband and I will not be returning a second time. Not impressed."
09/17/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Reservations for 6 for 6:30 but didn't get seated until 7:15, and every update was ""10 more minutes"". The front staff apologized profusely but there was also no convenient place to stand and wait other than leaning against a casino rail. Our waiter did an excellent job of getting us in and out since we had an event at 9 as well. A little surprising the manager didn't stop by until much later and had no idea of the delay. Unfortunately we could not relax and take our time as we wanted but everything else was excellent. Typical upscale a la carte prices, expect approx $100 a person for appetizer, entree, sides(which are huge and sharable), and 2 drinks, not including gratuity. No dress code, someone next to us was literally in basketball shorts and sandals. Food and drink were excellent as expected and splitting a check 5 ways plus dividing one persons equally amongst the rest were done with ease. Other than the wait everything was as expected from a restaurant with this reputation and caliber."
09/17/2016,OpenTable Diner,2.0,I had to have scallops replaced because came out cold and tasted funny. Replaced but not removed from Bill. Became violently ill later that evening. Would never go again........
09/17/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Wife and I celebrated our 25th Anniversary here prior to seeing the great Don Henley in concert.  Perfect match of great company, superb restaurant with great service and food and a wonderful performance by one of the world's great artists!  Great time!"
09/17/2016,Larry,5.0,"Our server Chris K was very attentive, but never over bearing.  Our third time at MJ’s and always a great experience.  The bone-in filet special was very flavorful."
09/16/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Great time, great food, great experience!  Will definitely be back."
09/16/2016,JCola,5.0,"Food was amazing, most notably the crab cake appetizer.  Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Steak, lobster tail, truffle fries and blue cheese garlic bread were also fantastic. The service was great, excellent wine selection & nice ambiance.  Will definitely be returning on my next visit to the casino.  Pricy, but worth it for a special meal!"
09/16/2016,Sundayoutsuedorrittchuck,3.0,"Looking for a good steakhouse, which this fit the bill

Food was very good, although the crabcakes came to the table cold. 

Service was OK but with lack of attention and a bit of an attitude. Apologized for cold crabcakes but no offer to make it up to us (free dessert or price adjustment).

 It seemed like that because we were a family of four and not a casino high roller (i.e. High spender), the attention was not up to my standard of the we spent on an expensive dinner. 

Would have to think about reccomending to someone who was not necessarily wanting a good steak."
09/16/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"If you're after a good steak with great sides while you are at Mohegan Sun, give MJ's a try.  We loved the bacon app, petite filets were plenty big and the truffle fries were out of this world.  Add to that attentive service by our waiter Ryan (who also helped us out w the wine list) and you know we left happy."
09/16/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Enjoyed our dinner to celebrate a birthday.  Service was great and prices were what you expect of a high end steakhouse.  The garlic bread appetizer was great, as was the braised short rib entree.  Steaks were cooked perfectly.  Really no complaints."
09/14/2016,DavidB,5.0,"Always great steaks, and great service. It's definitely expensive, but worth it for those special occasions."
09/12/2016,jeffS,4.0,"I ordered the 7 once filet medium and it was definitely Medium well.  In addition, the meal presentation was poor."
09/11/2016,gambler,4.0,I was celebrating my wife's birthday it was on 9/11 but no one asked if it was a special occasion..
09/10/2016,Lizzies1971,5.0,"Excellent Filet Mignon for me and T-Bone Steak for my husband.  We asked for meat to be cooked ""medium well"" which is so hard for restaurants to get right... we usually get our meat underdone and have to send it back, but Michael Jordan's NAILED it!   The asparagus side dish and the mushroom side dish were unbelievable.   It's a little on the expensive side, but well worth it if you are at Mohegan Sun."
09/10/2016,PaulT,4.0,"Dinner was great starting with the Garlic bread with Blue Cheese fondue. Filet was outstanding and everything else that was delivered to the tables around us looked awesome.
Wait staff was very professional and pleasant . Friendly and well spoken. Nice smiles and very helpful. We've been there several times and have always had a great meal. Will certainly be back."
09/10/2016,BrittanyDes,5.0,Had reservations at 615 and we immediately got seated. Jimmy was our waiter and he was outstanding. He gave us the typical lo down of the menu and let us know the sides were well enough for 2 people which I am so happy he let us know that. That Mashed potato trio?! To DIE for. That was probably the best steak (petite filet) I ever had. Medium rare is what you asked for? That's what you'll get. It was absolutely amazing and I will definitely be coming back for another occasion. Thanks Jimmy!!!
09/10/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Great food! Service was also great - didn't feel rush,  very relaxing.  Our reservation was the perfect time, before it got too busy & a little loud when we left. I would definitely would book the same time again!  Thanks for a great B-day dinner! :)"
09/05/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Went to Michael Jordan's Steakhouse at Mohegan Sun for the sole purpose of having a really nice steak dinner. The steak options were excellent, my boyfriend got the Kansas city bone-in strip and I got the filet mignon. Both were excellent. We ordered a couple side dishes, they were just okay. I thought the asparagus were a little too soft and not presented as nicely as the macaroni and cheese. The wine selection was also very good, we had a glass of red and a half bottle. The service was also very good, both the wait staff and the bus boys were very helpful and friendly."
09/05/2016,David,4.0,Some type of side dish should be included with the main dish.  a choice of a side.  But the food and service was wonderful!

09/02/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellent service and an outstanding meal. We are always very pleased with the steakhouse. Just divine.
09/01/2016,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Food was excellent but the table next to us was very loud and the gentleman kept standing up telling a story very loud and laughing and a waiter and a waitress were standing there laughing with the 2 others at the table  it was very rude and loud and we came very close to walking out. We were quite disappointed that the manager on duty said nothing to these gentelmen and it ruined our visit.  Since your restaurant is listed under fine dining which it is in price and food quality but certainly not in Noise level We felt like we were sitting in a bar.

Then  we asked for the bill and received someone else's and had to wait for the waitress who appeared to be setting up a table  for a large group to give us the correct bill she was very apologetic . Sorry but I don't think we,ll go back to your restaurant but may try the one in Manhattan !"
08/29/2016,KristineM,4.0,Dinner was very good. Cake tasted stale and over priced (cake)  Service started out good but at the end we felt like they forgot about us
08/28/2016,GeorgeM,5.0,"For years we have celebrated our daughter's birthday at Michael Jordan's (Mohegan Sun).  She counts on it, especially the 23-layer chocolate cake (and the steak, too)."
08/28/2016,fredk,2.0,"To command the price point that this restaurant commands, it should be in par or exceed other similarly situated steakhouses, and it does not.  The server was less than helpful particularly in checking to see if everything was cooked to our liking.  Moreover, she failed to explain any of the sauces served with the seafood tower or the sauces that were served with the steak.  Generally, the service was ""adequate"" if not lacking.  I may not return to this restaurant again."
08/27/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,I've been to MJ's restaurant a couple of times and have always loved the steaks. It was a great place to bring my girlfriend for the first time and enjoy an exquisite meal.

08/20/2016,OpenTable Diner,2.0,Noise was deafening.    Food was good but you can't hear what your guests are saying.   Terrible.
08/20/2016,Bren,4.0,"We had a delicious dinner last evening . Three in our party selected the NY strip. They were cooked perfectly. Extremely tender and flavorful. I chose the salmon, which was  cooked well and a very generous portion. As sides, we chose a huge baked potato, mac and cheese and a chopped salad. And a must is their garlic bread!
We will return to this restaurant."
08/20/2016,FlandTx,5.0,"It was a unique in that the entire experience was excellent from the sevice, ambience and the delicious food.   The food and drink  selection offered a few specially items that added a bonus on an already top quality dinner."
08/19/2016,UxVegas,4.0,"First time attending MJ's Steakhouse at Mohegan Sun and my wife and I were pretty happy overall with our experience. We started with the chilled seafood platter (oysters, lobster, shrimp, crab, and clams) which was a tad pricey ($69 for the small size) but REALLY REALLY GOOD. For dinner I had the 10oz Filet Mignon (with sides of Asparagus & Barley Pilaf)and my wife had the Maine Lobster dish both excellent and perfectly cooked.

For dessert, my wife ordered the 23 layer chocolate cake for us to share.  It looked amazing when the waiter brought it to the table, but it looked WAY BETTER than it tasted.  My wife and I were really disappointed as the cake was cold and had a chemically taste to it (we only had a couple bites). It was an unfortunate sour note in an otherwise good evening.  NOTE: Our waiter recommended the Baked Alaska or Boston Cream Pie sgoodo we probably should have followed his advice.

Service was good not great (waiter kept asking us if we wanted more drinks even when we repeatedly said no).

This is a good place to go if price is not an issue and you want to splurge for a really good dinner.  Just watch out for your dessert selection."
08/19/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great restaurant.  Highly recommend the filet mignon.

08/17/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Michael Jordan's is a high end and high expectation steak restaurant. Our filet mignons were perfectly cooked and excellent. Service is impeccable. We ordered the sautéed mushroom as a side order which were not good. The restaurant had the air conditioning on too low and it was cold. Nevertheless , the meal and experience were noteworthy."
08/13/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Had a 8.45 reservation and they actually accomodated us much early at our request. Very friendly staff and the food was excellent
08/13/2016,JamiR,5.0,"Every time I visit Mohegan Sun for a special event, I make sure to have dinner at Michael Jordan's.  The menu has something for everyone. The server, Jessica, was incredible and attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. I especially love the seafood tower and the Bread with Bleu Cheese Fondue. And the cocktail menu is perfection."
08/13/2016,MichaelP,4.0,Very good as usual.  Only complaint was we sat in the area first come first serve and people were hovering over us so we felt like we we’re pressured
08/12/2016,Cyra,2.0,"The food sucked, it's gone way downhill"
08/12/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The service and food was excellent well worth the trip there. I would highly recommended to everyone.
08/11/2016,RichR,2.0,I have eaten at this Michael Jordan's location a number of times and on the last two dining events the quality of the porterhouse steak is going downhill (quite fatty and tough). The attentiveness of the table staff is not acceptable either. It was my observation that some tables received very reasonable attention and many others (unfortunately mine one of those) were searching for their waiter for service follow up. I will not dine at this location again.
08/07/2016,Cathy,4.0,"Another great dinner at Michael Jordan's.   Service was, as always, outstanding. 

Porterhouse for Two easily fed four of us,  and was prepared perfectly.  We did a side of the excellent creamed spinach and a couple of salads as well.  A bottle of wine went beautifully with the meal.  The 23 layer chocolate cake was more than enough for the four of us to share!Their garlic bread is not to be missed! 

My favorite restaurant at Mohegan."
08/07/2016,Jimmy,4.0,"Great steaks, seveice was top notch, food was well prepared, staff were wonderful. Pricey but worth the occasional splurge. My second visit, will go again."
08/07/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,It was just ok. Service super slow. Maybe try again.
08/06/2016,eddrotman,3.0,"We eat frequently at MJ and usually our steaks are excellent.  This time they were disappointing.
We ordered ribeyes with bone in.  We were disappointed because the steaks were somewhat fiberous and the bone hardly existed it was so small.
We should have brought it to the attention of the waiter but we didnt bother.  I question, know that we are thinking about it,  whether the steaks were in fact ribeyes with bone in/"
08/06/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"My boyfriend and I ordered the porterhouse for two with sides of creamed spinach and fries. The porterhouse was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. It came with two sauces, a white sauce and a cinnamon  sauce. The cinnamon sauce went great with the steak. The fries were off the charts, along with the cream spinach. I had a watermelon jalapeño martini straight up, which was sooo good"
08/05/2016,DinaD,5.0,Great service great atmosphere & delicious food! It was my daughters 21st bday & server gave her a cupcake with candle on the house!! Very nice

08/02/2016,MarkM,5.0,I made reservations for my wife and I for our 13th anniversary.  I had high expectations going in and the food was absolutely fantastic.  Might be the best meal my wife and I ever had.  We can't wait to go back.  The service was just as good as the food.  I highly recommend.
08/01/2016,wineanddineme,5.0,"Classic steakhouse food. Steak was on point. Service was top notch. Wine selection was massive and delightful. We would not only return, but recommend Michael Jordan'a Steakhouse to others as well. Great for a party of two or a group."
08/01/2016,HeatherR,4.0,"Food was excellent but the prices are high which is why we only go on special occasions. Our waitress, Danielle, was very friendly, knowledgeable and efficient."
07/30/2016,LynnK,3.0,"The waiter must have been having an off night.  The service was terrible.  We had to wait for everything, including clearing off the table."
07/30/2016,KimV,4.0,"The service was a little slow and our waiter was not very attentative.  Other than that, food and atmosphere were excellent."
07/30/2016,GolbertI,5.0,"I love the relaxed feel of this place – like a comfortable dining room in a friends home. I definitely would return to try more dishes. The aged Porterhouse was cooked perfectly at medium rare. As an steak aficionado; I would say is the second best steak I had so far. Loved the Lobster mashed potatoes. The salad was a good size and with an excellent mixture of legumes and fruit. Menu is on the up side but worth it. Friends from South America were very impressed 
with the service and the quality."
07/30/2016,KristineD,5.0,Amazing food. Best meal I've had in a long time! Definitely try the baked Alaska.
07/29/2016,JeramiahL,3.0,"First time dining here, heard good reviews, took wife for a special surprise occasion and was not impressed at all for what we paid.  I've had way better meals and portion sizes for a third of the price. Noise level was a bit high.  Was not an enjoyable experience for us!"
07/29/2016,TheRads,5.0,"Michael Jordan's is a WONDERFUL steak house!  Chris K. was our waiter, and he was attentive, without being obtrusive.  Very knowledgeable and a real pro.  Would definitely ask for him again for future dining.  Amanda, one of the managers, was outstanding.  Knowing it was my husband's 85th birthday, she made sure to send a scrumptious 22 layer cake, chocolate, to the table.  The ""slice"" was so huge we left over 1/2 of it.  Kudos to the staff and the restaurant."
07/29/2016,MaribethM,5.0,Food was delicious and service was great. My friend and I shared the steak for two and it was cooked exactly how we asked. The chopped salad was delicious too.
07/29/2016,ThaianyN,4.0,"My husband and I ate here for our anniversary dinner this past weekend and loved it.  We were seated in a booth that made the whole dinner feel more private and romantic. A glass of champagne was served on the house at the end of the meal as we were celebrating our anniversary and a card signed by Michael Jordan was left on the table (which we unfortunately forgot!). Reservations are highly recommended! Definitely try the 23 layer cake for dessert, YUM!"
07/29/2016,jpadr,5.0,The steaks were excellent and so was the shrimp cocktail. $$$$
07/28/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"excellent from the time I made reservation until the end of our dinner.  All of our requests were met with great satisfaction.  It was our Mother's 75th birthday celebration with 7 of us in attendance.  I ordered flowers for the table through Open table link and they were delivered just as pictured and were on the table when we arrived.  I spoke to someone at restaurant about a cake with a candle for dessert.  He suggested we order a piece of the 14 layer chocolate cake, and that the chef would write happy birthday on the plate.  After dinner our waiter brought out a whole cake that was beautifully decorated and had happy birthday written on the cake.  What a nice surprise, we even took the rest of the cake home.  Appetizers were outstanding.  We were curious about the bacon appetizer after having read other reviews about it    I would definitely get it again.  It was very tasty and easy to share.  Dinner was excellent.  Steaks, scallops, and lobster were all exceptional.  We also shared a few sides that were very nice.    Very nice selection of wine, champagne and spirits.  Can't say enough good about our entire experience.   Its nice to know that you can consistently get great food and service at Michael Jordans CT."
07/28/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"This was our first experience at MJ's, the bar was great, the bar tender was very friendly and professional and well versed in his trade. We had a great booth and an excellent dinner. The food was outstanding, a little pricing but worth it, portions are large. Our waiter was Brian, he was fantastic. We would go back in a heart beat!"
07/27/2016,shapgo,3.0,"This restaurant is very overpriced.  We had the iceberg lettuce wedge which was okay and we shared the porterhouse which was okay. The Parmesan crusted spinach was not great and the baked potato was enormous so we shared that. We always love the 23 layer cake for dessert but we felt that it was not as good as past years.
The service was not the greatest.  We had to wait way too long for our salad and our steak. The steak arrived lukewarm and we had to send it back to be reheated.  For these prices you would think that there would be more attention at the table. We had to request a bread basket and then salt and pepper.
We have eaten here several times but not for a while. It seems that it has gone downhill a bit."
07/25/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Our first time at any Michael Jordan's, and it was amazing. Not only was the food delicious, but our server Julie was 100% attentive, had extensive knowledge of the menu, and knew ingredients of all dishes so that I could enjoy my meal as I need to be gluten free. She assured me also that she would alert our chef so no cross-contamination would occur. The filet was easily in the top 3 of any I'd ever had, and the crab leg appetizer and burrata-heirloom tomato salad were incredibly fresh and tasty. And do yourself a favor--order the mashed potato trio! Best mashed ever!"
07/24/2016,Joan,2.0,Rib eye was chewy
07/24/2016,ChristineB,5.0,"everything was fabulous!  from the table, service and food-especially our favorite the bone in rib eye never fails us!!!!"
07/24/2016,Happy,5.0,"The petite Fillet Mignon topped with the King Crab Meat Oscar was excellent!  I wasn't  really sure what it was but the waitress answered all my questions. My husband also had the fillet along with the grilled corn side which was enough for us to share. This was not my first visit but sure won't be our last. The only problem was the air conditioning, it was much too cold"
07/24/2016,JeffreyR,5.0,"Scrumptious food, Kansas City rib eye cooked perfectly and juicy. Excellent creamed spinach and corn off the cob side dishes. Attentive service, great atmosphere. Best restaurant at Mohegan Sun."
07/24/2016,Ketoguy,5.0,"Very good steak, cooked perfectly.  Bacon appetizer is delicious!
  It might be my imagination but we always find the meal better here than at Grand Central Station location."
07/23/2016,EdwardJ,3.0,"Overall, our expectation's left a lot to be desired!! First item, coffee was absolutely terrible!! Wife's asparagus was sent back twice for more cooking, still was not right!! My french fry's had some vile coating on them, wife's succatash contained some unpleasant smell!! Food quality was mediocre. Service was prompt however no one ever asked if everything was all right!! We would NOT recommend Michael Jordan's !!"
07/23/2016,MatthewS,5.0,"What agreat evening.   The service was wonderful.   The  amazing,  staff was very friendly and courtesy."
07/23/2016,KimR,5.0,"Everything from our  complimentary champagne &  signed note card from Michael Jordan (for our anniversary),  to our attentive, personable server and  last bite of food was amazing!  Our server, Bryan C, described the food to us in a way that made my mouth water.  His recommendations for food choices were spot on and most enjoyable!  He is very knowledgeable and passionate about his job at MJ's Steakhouse.   The bacon appetizer and the steaks we had were to die for!!  Well worth the high price for the quality of food we ordered!  The chefs are culinary geniuses!  What an awesome dining experience we had."
07/23/2016,RoxaneA,2.0,"We have eaten at Michael Jordans a number of times but this evening our server (Chris) was not very good.  He was not attentive and our main entree came out rather fast after our appetizers.  He did not bring out the butter and the sour cream with the potato which was not fully cooked.  The side scallops were served alone without the risotto that was supposed to be with it.   He did not come over and ask if we needed another round of drinks.  We had to ask the bus boy to get our waiter to come over.  The fillet was excellent as always.  For the amount of money that they charge per entree, the service should be impeccable."
07/22/2016,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"Made Reservations for two (2) on 7/22/2016
I ordered the Heirloom Tomato appetizer @ $ 14.00 Received a small amount of tomatoes.
My date ordered the shrimp cocktail @  $19.00 Four (4) shrimp was delivered on her plate. 
I ordered the filet, @ $ 40.00, cooked medium, received well done. My date ordered scallops, she received four (4). With drinks, my final bill was about $ 92.00. I travel extensively across the US and have eaten in many steakhouses. (Morton's, Ruth Crist, Don Fresco's, ETC.) I was disappointed with the portion sizes for the price, but perhaps you have found that the ""casino"" customer is less knowledgeable about what fine dining really is.
I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone based on my experience"
07/22/2016,JoeL,5.0,"Incredible Food!!

The waiting staff was very friendly while the food was incredible. The Rib-Eye steak was the best I have ever had from any restaurant. The staff was very pleasurable and friendly."
07/21/2016,JAlexC,5.0,Fantastic place with extremely friendly and helpful wait staff who are dedicated to making your experience a great one.  Super crowded on a Thursday night and was lucky to have a reservation prior to  a concert.  The food was ridiculously good - perhaps the best bone in fillet I've had in a long time- had a side of corn off the cob and baked potato and both were amazing- great wine list and can't wait to go back.
07/21/2016,AilisM,4.0,Great night once again. Best dining experience by far at Mohegan Sun and has been for many years. Can't wait to go back.
07/21/2016,BillV,5.0,Went there with my son. The meal was fantastic. Some of the best steaks we've ever had. Good wine selection. The side dishes are wonderful. I have been there a few times. Every time is a great experience. The staff is great too!
07/21/2016,JennaB,5.0,"Michael Jordan's has become our favorite dining destination at Mohegan Sun, and our most recent visit confirmed why.   We mentioned it was our anniversary and were given complimentary champagne for a toast. Our steaks were perfectly prepared and of exceptional quality.  The mashed potato trio was delicious.  Our server was fantastic, attentive but not overly so.  It was a wonderful dining experience!"
07/20/2016,JOHNS,5.0,Some of the best steaks I have had anywhere. Perfect service. Wonderful setting. Exceptional in every way.
07/16/2016,Pro72,4.0,"Very consistent, great quality, service friendly and professional."
07/16/2016,RobL,5.0,"The food is awesome! This was our second time dining here and was amazing. I highly recommend the garlic bread with blue cheese sauce. As a non blue cheese fan, i would love to eat this often. For the main corse we had delmonico steaks and we split a lobster tail and parmesan french fries. The drinks were pretty good also. Be prepared to pay for the quality though as both times we have paid in excess of $250 for 2. We will be back!"
07/15/2016,Valentine,5.0,An amazing place. Terrific food. Very accommodating.
07/10/2016,TasteBuddies,5.0,"Four of us dined at MJ's Steakhouse to celebrate the birthday of an out of town relative.  We had salmon, scallops, rib eye and steak.  The appetizers and sides were family size portions.  Everything was delicious, adequate temperature, and brought out in a timely and engaging way by servers.  Our server Jules was very attentive.  She listened to & recalled our preferences very well.  She even picked up on things that we  understated or quietly stated to each other.  Jules is exceptional at what she does.  We are repeat diners at MJ's, but Jules made this particular dining experience very enjoyable.  She topped off our dinner with a delectable layered Boston cream angel food cake that she drenched with a tasty chocolate sauce for the table to share."
07/09/2016,DaveY,5.0,Great spot and food was excellent.  Porterhouse for two was done just right and sides were great. Nice quiet table in rear of restaurant.
07/08/2016,Snakes66,5.0,Always a great experience at MJ.   Never disappointed.   Steaks are impeccably prepared. Wine list is vast and service. what can I say.  Highly recommended
07/06/2016,JeffR,5.0,Great food and wonderful service! What a special place!
07/06/2016,partygroup,4.0,Great dinner and fine service as always. Seafood tower is very fresh and steaks cooked perfectly.
07/06/2016,Mango68,2.0,"Place was empty but we were sat right next to the only tables that were there. We just wanted some dinner before going home. The waiter made us feel like peasants for ordering tap water and ""house bread"". We ordered 2 apps and shared a dinner. We were again made to feel like we were cheap. It was 9:00 and that is all we wanted. Our shared entree was very salty and over cooked. Short ribs need liquid, not black very thick and sooo salty. It seemed like it was over cooked and then they added water to moisten it. It was very bitter. The wine in the sauce for the cavatelli was all you could taste and was also very  bitter. The bread was like dry air and crumbly. It tasted like stale bread and was definitely more than day old. Another waiter was the only thing good about the service. We saw him more than our waiter. Once our waiter realized he wasn't able to upsell  us, he wasn't there much. The other waiter took better care of us and delivered both courses."
07/05/2016,DeeN5974,5.0,They made the celebration of our 35th Wedding Anniversary very special.  The service was excellent as always and we are always made to feel welcome every time we have dinner there.  I always highly recommend Michael Jordan's to everyone I know is going to Mohegan Sun.  The food is high quality and prepared to our expectations.
07/03/2016,Jacque,5.0,Service was absolutely great and the food was delicious.  We had a glitch with one of our orders and it was corrected immediately. I recommend this restaurant a true gem.
07/03/2016,GaryH,3.0,"Food sides were cold, juice in my not crazyover thecocktails"
07/03/2016,Terry,4.0,I made a reservation and had to wait anyway because they took walk-ins before us.  They said that had to wait for more servers to get on duty.  Thought they had a light reservation list so didn't have as many servers on staff.  Some items are very overpriced and not worth the cost.  Had a Mohegan Sun Gift Certificate and choose Michael Jordan's Steakhouse as our choice.  Should have tried somewhere else.
07/03/2016,MikeP,5.0,Great place good service ..aand getting a table was easy as pie with the open table app.
07/03/2016,ShaynaH,5.0,The food and service were great.  Our orders were prompt and the server was very attentive.

Look firwArd to returning soon"
06/28/2016,1goodtym,5.0,"25th wedding  anniversary dinner with my wife was fantastic here.
arrived at 7pm was greeted by 2 hosts seated at table by kitchen doorway. Asked to move and was promptly seated at another table away from the hustle and bustle of the wait staff. Our server Danielle was very attentive and super nice. Every item was cooked to perfection and we were very satisfied with our meal and service..Michael Jordan should be proud of the staff here the assistant manager also stopped by to introduce herself and make sure everything was to our satisfaction.Which it was thanks for an excellent dining experience...would recommend to all...thanks"
06/26/2016,SeanR,1.0,"worst experience I have ever had at a steakhouse.   Steaks were way overcooked , app was very fatty. Paying $50 a steak and had to ask for rolls.  I have had better meals at the outback.  Michael Jordan should be embarrassed to have his name attached to this place.   It was just all terrible."
06/26/2016,Patm,3.0,Food was good but overpriced. We also felt rushed right after we ate our entrée.  They remove plates while others at the table are still eating.
06/25/2016,JohnV,5.0,"Very impressed. Steak was outrageous. Cooked to perfection. Service was 2nd to none. I would have dinner there anytime !!
Absolutely perfect."
06/25/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,This was the 3rd or 4th time that I have eaten at Michael Jordan's steak house and each time it has been excellent.
06/25/2016,DavidM,5.0,Great place to dine. All the food was excellent and prepared perfectly. Service was second to none.
06/25/2016,BarbaraC,5.0,Excellent food.   Great service.   Would definitely recommend!
06/25/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Scrumptious food with outstanding service!
06/25/2016,jdr1,3.0,Very nice place Food was just okay but the service was excellent. Too much mesquite in food and a little salty. Like the idea but food needs improvement.
06/25/2016,SueM,5.0,"A little pricey, but the Trio mashed potatoes were amazing.  Great service!"
06/25/2016,DrTMS,2.0,"I go to fine dining establishments quite often, and put Jordan's at the bottom of the list.  My $69.00 rib eye was half far and grizzle.  When I mentioned it to the waiter he ignored me. So I asked for a manager, who keep insisting that she could bring me another steak, I said no and ultimately they took if of the check. 
Prices are high , and fair at best( would expect much more from a "" steakhouse "".
The dining room is also very noisy, so much so that I found myself yelling to my friends across the table. One other think is that the wine list is a rip off, charging three or four times why the bottle would be in the store.
Save time and money and don't go to Jordan's steakhouse."
06/24/2016,NancyT,5.0,This was by far the best steak I have ever had... I had the special that evening . My steak was accompanied by a lobster tail. Also was delicious. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone.
06/24/2016,LisaH,5.0,Best steak we ever had.  Definitely worth it.   Went with five others and all were happy with their meals
06/23/2016,NSfoodie,5.0,"Food was outstanding and staff was amazing, very accommodating!!"
06/23/2016,Gwen,5.0,"I wasn't expecting much. The decor was austere. The wait staff friendly, knowledgeable and attentive enough. The food was surprising very good. (I thought a restaurant owned by a flashy athlete was be adequate, at best.) My short ribs were perfectly prepared. My husband, who is a very picky eater, enjoyed his steak. We will definitely visit again."
06/19/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"We had terrific experience for Father's day dinner.  Both my husband and daughter had steaks and they were quite pleased.  I had Salmon and it was great.  My side dish, however, was quite salty and I did not feel that it was given much attention even after it was returned.  The explanation was not enough and left a bit of salty taste in mouth, pun intended.  Nothing additional was offered to compensate for that experience and considering the high cost of each dish."
06/19/2016,KevinG,5.0,"My Wife & I  had a Wonderful Anniversary Dinner at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse. 
Our Waitress was nice & attentive. 
We ordered an appetizer, the Garlic Bread Fondue, which was delicious.
We ordered the Salmon & Chicken dishes, along with the Trio Mashed Potatoes as a side. It was all delicious & felt like it came out in no time at all.
We will definitely be returning again!!"
06/19/2016,MichaelS,5.0,"Dined on Saturday 6/18/16 Staff friendly, courteous and knowledgeable. We ordered the petite filet mignonette cooked to order sides were just as good. Highly recommend"
06/18/2016,HarryP,5.0,"Have dinned at MJ's on several occasions -  It is always excellent! My only criticism would be the noise level within the restaurant - yes, high energy from the groups dinning on Saturday nights. During the week, not so much noise where  a person can carry on a conversation at a normal level."
06/18/2016,ElisabethT,5.0,"The atmosphere, service, and food were all impeccable!"
06/18/2016,JackH,2.0,Our reservation was for 6:00 at the recommendation of the hotel.  We ordered promptly.  Service was very slow so we only had time for our salad.  Otherwise we would not have been able to get to our show on time.  The manager handled it professionally and the server was apologetic.  But it was an hour between our order and the serving of the entre' which we did not have time to enjoy.
06/18/2016,Pops,5.0,Service and food was timed perfectly to enable us to make it to the show.
06/17/2016,LarryK,5.0,Michael Jordan's is a top notch spot.  The steak is as good as you will find in any steak house.  Our second visit and we will be back.
06/12/2016,OpenTable Diner,3.0,25 min.'s to have drinks served was surprising considering most of the customers had left for the show.
06/12/2016,LizM,5.0,Amazing steak and great wait staff and bartenders.
06/12/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Food was excellent. Service was excellent. They're a little on the pricey side for what you're getting but you have to figure that for the casino location. I'd go back again, but make sure you take a look at the menu ahead of time. Limited selection, higher prices, but excellent quality food and service. You get what you pay for."
06/11/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We went here for our anniversary dinner and it was one of the best meals we've had in a very long time. We ordered the bacon appetizer, which was the most delicious thing I've ever eaten, the chopped salad, and we each ordered a steak that was cooked to perfection. The food was simply exceptional.  The service was also top notch- very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful!  I think we are going to have to make this an annual event, we can't wait to make the trip back..."
06/11/2016,DCSC,5.0,We had a great overall experience at Michael Jordan's.  The food was excellent and our server was very personable and attentive.

06/09/2016,ReginaA,5.0,"We visited family in CT and Michael Jordan's is a regular treat every visit. The service is always warm & welcoming. Food options never disappoint...the garlic bread with cheese fondue is a must. We tried several sides (creamed spinach, corn, etc) that were flavorful and definitely perfect for sharing. And the desserts...ahhhh.....key lime pie, Creme brûlée and a seasonal strawberry shortcake type dessert...all were phenomenal. Try it, you won't be disappointed."
06/04/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The apps, steaks, sides and dessert were all delicious and cooked perfectly!"
06/03/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The Porterhouse for 2 was the best thing I've ever eaten!

05/30/2016,kmack,4.0,We had a very nice meal and also a very nice overall experience. Our reservation was honored after just a few minute wait. The service was very good and our meals were excellent.
05/28/2016,RobynO,4.0,My husband and I were at Mohegan Sun for the weekend. We love the New York restaurant so we figured it must be good too and it was. Food was great....
05/28/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"From the before dinner drink to the dessert, everything was fantastic.  Blood orange Cosmopolitans with Solerno were awesome.  the garlic bread appetizer was delicious.  The steaks were so tender, not sure why they give you steak knives; a spoon will cut them.  Cooked to perfection and delicious.  The trio of baked potatoes was a nice accompaniment.  The Shiraz wine was an excellent find.  The baked Alaska was so smooth.  Really, simply an awesome experience."
05/27/2016,PamF,5.0,"Fabulous food, great service ! It was my birthday and they were great to us! Free dessert wonderful filet just perfect would highly recommend if you want a fantastic meal!"
05/27/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,This is a must... Amazing service and food is spot on.... Highly recommend visiting MJ's @ Mohegan Sun..
05/27/2016,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"Sorry to say, our visit was very disappointing.  We have been to Michael Jordan's on several occasions in the past, it's where we go for dinner whenever we stay at Mohegan Sun.  We brought friends and recommended the place.  First was the wine order, after our server suggested a bottle she came back to say it wasn't available after all.  She was quite nice.
Then our dinners took a very long time to come out, and when the entrée arrived it took another 5-10 minutes for the sides to arrive, so our dinner was getting cold while waiting.  Once arrived our guests were quite disappointed with the temps of the steak and quality, especially given the reputation of Michael Jordans.   They did give us a complimentary split of wine but it was embarrassing and unfortunate after spending $300 for dinner.  What happened?"
05/25/2016,ArthurC,3.0,Service was very bad had to ask 3 times for my waiter throughout the dinner. It was disappointing since it was my son's 21 birthday.  Not a good value for the prices that they charge.
05/21/2016,Daniella,4.0,"There are a lot of great restaurants at Mohegan Sun, however, MJ's has proven to be the very best option time and time again. Food is always spot on, service is always impeccable and I've never left feeling like I didn't get my money's worth. I recommend that you make a reservation, particularly on a Thursday - Saturday night because the secret is out and this place gets BUSY!"
05/21/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Our server Julie D was fantastic. When I tasked her to recommend a wine to go with our meal selections she pointed out several and one in particular which we selected and was spot on. She made sure everything was to our satisfaction.
05/21/2016,CindiC,5.0,"We had reservations for my husband's birthday Saturday night. They greeted us with champagne, and a birthday card from Michael ! Our waitress was top-notch! Never missed a beat, was attentive, there when we needed her, smiling, friendly.
We started off with the lobster won tons & tuna tartar, both were good, more acid on the the tartar might have given it more flavour.
 Entrée: My husband had the sirloin, I had the scallops. He said his was better than Ruth Chris'.
 I had the creamed spinach ( to die for) and he had mushrooms and onions ( delish) we were so full we couldn't have dessert!
The staff was attentive from the minute we got to the door until we left.
Good job, we will be back!"
05/21/2016,StevenF,5.0,The staff was charming and attentive from the moment we walked through the door. The food was superb to match.
05/20/2016,dianer,4.0,"Everything was delicious. Our waiter was fabulous. We shared a rib eye, creamed spinach and mushrooms and onions which was perfect for 2. We each had our own appetizer and it was just enough. Thanks for making our 23rd wedding anniversary special."
05/20/2016,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Found the steak nothing special. Overpriced. Restaurant was nice but that's where it stopped. Waiter seemed to disregard our table after we didn't buy alcoholic drinks.
05/17/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary.  The food was wonderful and the service from our waiter was perfect.  I would definitely recommend Michael Jordan's Steakhouse to family, friends, co-workers etc."
05/15/2016,ArtG,3.0,"I expected much more in the way of food. The sides were the best.  For $59 my lobster was certainly on the small side and it was served warm at best, not hot. Two of the three other dishes needed to be sent back because they were not cooked properly.  The well advertised 23 later chocolate cake was underwhelming.  Did not seem fresh.  I won't be going back."
05/15/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Steak cooked to perfection.  Mac and Lobster was to die for.  Excellent Cab!
05/15/2016,OpenTable Diner,3.0,The meal and our waiter and assistant were wonderful. The air conditioning vent was above us so it was a bit cold. had to leave my coat on. Asked to be moved but there would be an additional wait.  Checking in at the desk when we were told our table was ready we told them we had to pay the bar tab first. Took a couple of minutes as the bar was busy. When we went to get seated we then had to wait and they seated 2 other parties prior to seating us at the table with the ac hitting us. That started the evening off on a poor note. Glad that our meal was exceptional otherwise
05/15/2016,Xrdmen,3.0,"G A R L I C B R E A D BLUE CHEESE FONDUE 10.-Awesome! got to have this if you go.  Do make sure you like blue cheese, otherwise may be to rich for the taste.

COLOSSAL CRAB CAKE MEYER LEMON AIOLI, MICRO GREENS 20. Awesome! got to have this if you go.   Mostly real crab meet, no bread.  I would go there just for this appetizer

1LB BAKED POTATO SOUR CREAM, BUTTER, SMOKED CHEDDAR 10. -big enough to share.  Condiments are served separately and the potato was not hot enough to melt the butter or the cheddar.

Main course- Tried the Special steak with crab cake on top at about $62-  was not impressed by the size considering this was supposed to be an 18oz. steak.  Sorry, M. Jordan this one is way short of expectations when compared to a Delmonico's, Ruth Chris or Keens Steakhouse.  You should not be charging those prices.  Would not have paid more than $35 for that special.  Out of words!

Also tried the 10oz filet- overcooked (requested Medium) almost to well done.  Again, not impressed for the price.

Finally, you have to remove that two person table right next to the main path.  It is very distracting and provides no privacy with the door to the kitchen on one side and people coming and going on that main corridor."
05/15/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We went for a friend's jack and jill weekend. Enjoyed an amazing, delicious meal. From the wine selection to the apps to the entree. I would recommend it to anyone!"
05/14/2016,Steve,4.0,"All in all excellent as always; however, the tuna tartar app we consistently order was different this time. No seasoning (soy, wasbi, sesame - nothing) and mushy rather than firm pieces. Maybe a different/new cook?

Will try again and hope we receive the top notch app we typically receive.

Lump crab cake, blue cheese garlic bread, steak, soup and sides were terrific. Service is always wonderful."
05/14/2016,TimothyT,5.0,The porterhouse for two was perfectly done. Sides were great too. Baked Alaska was incredible save room for it.
05/13/2016,SusanO,2.0,I booked this restaurant for my husband's birthday.  I was extremely disappointed in the seating.  We were placed near the register and dish area. The noise level was ridiculous and the service was poor.  Our waitress was thoughtful but we were never offered more of anything.  The steak was OK but nothing compared to Ruth Chris.
05/13/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"What a great dining experience. One would assume that it was MichaelJordan Steakhouse, its staff would be snotty, but total opposite, Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Food was superb !!!We would recommend the restaurant to anyone. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
05/12/2016,MarkO,5.0,"excellent food, atmosphere & staff!!! Rolls were a favorite."
05/11/2016,MillB,5.0,"This is about the 5th time I have eaten at MJ's. I have gone w/ different friends and family and to a person we all have high praise for the steak ( all types) , as well as the rest of the fare. 
The staff as a whole are courteous and efficient. We will definitely be back!
Thank you."
05/08/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Mother's Day. Every server's nightmare. But Chris didn't let us think for a second that our all-woman table might be suspect as bad tippers usually found on that holiday. 

His service was friendly and smooth.  Will definitely go back."
05/08/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We brought another couple, they loved the wine choices.  The dinners, we had 3 steaks (filet, Delmonico, and Rib Eye, all different and scallops.  The veggies, family style, 2 were enough for everyone.  Extremely enjoyable evening!  Must try for everyone, who enjoys a great steak!"
05/08/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The service was the best, the menu extensive, and the desserts not to be skipped. Leave your calorie counter at home and wear something with an elastic waist band. My kids (under 13) loved it too."
05/08/2016,Judy56,5.0,"Excellent Mother's Day special. As always, the steak was tender and cooked to perfection. Looking forward to  my next visit."
05/08/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"From the food to the service, amazing as always"
05/08/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,From start to finish our experience was great.  Filet was absolutely delicious and the martinis were perfect.  Our server was extremely helpful and went above and beyond making our experience fantastic.
05/08/2016,JoyceC,4.0,"WE WOULD DEFINITELY RETURN.  WAITSTAFF ATTENTIVE AND HELPFUL.  WOULD HAVE GIVEN 5 STARS BUT BAKED POTATOES WERE NOT COOKED.  IF YOUR SERVING THEM, THEY SHOULD BE PERFECT!"
05/07/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Service was excellent and the ambiance was awsome they had a 7:15 opening within 5 minutes, we were right there and exactly 7:15 we showed up and were seated within 3 minutes!!!! Great app,OPEN TABKE!!!!"
05/01/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"I had bone in rib eye and mom had the lamb, both were 1st class . Shrimp cocktail was very good and so was asparagus. I was quite disappointed there was not more choices for vegetables  and a ""steak house"" that does not offer flakey oven baked potatoes was a little weird?"
05/01/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We went to Michael Jordan's Steakhouse at Mohegan for our anniversary.  We were greeted with complimentary champagne which was so sweet of them.  Our waitress, Jules, was awesome!  She went over the whole menu with us, was friendly, and was so kind.

Food was delicious.   The only little tip I have, is to make sure that the steaks are warm/hot for the guest.  Ours were on the coolish-warm side which was fine, but didn't feel like it came RIGHT from being cooked.  More like it sat out for a few.   Still though---it was delish."
05/01/2016,JackieQ,5.0,Had dinner at Michael Jordan's this past weekend with two other couples.  Have gone to this restaurant once a year for the last six years to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and have never been disappointed.  The food is delicious and the staff is very attentive.  It is pricey but you expect that from a high-end steak house.  One thing my boyfriend always comments on is how comfortable the chairs are.  We were there for almost three hours drinking and eating.  No one rushed us.  I would highly recommend it.
04/30/2016,JoeU,4.0,I have never had a bad meal there and service is always excellent. Our server had knowledge pertaining to the menu as well as the wine list. She picked a great red wine for me which truly accommodated our meal. Never disappointed with the place.
04/30/2016,KevinL,5.0,My wife and I have eaten here several times and this last time was by far the BEST.  Steak had exceptional flavor and literally fell apart in my mouth it was soooo tender.  Absolutely incredible meal that was well worth the price.  Can't wait to go back!
04/24/2016,vman465,5.0,"Once again, My Wife and I love coming here and like always, everything is on point! Food is just phenomenal!"
04/23/2016,LakeGirlTravels,4.0,"This restaurant is consistently fabulous.  The waitstaff is top-notch and catered to our every need despite it being a very busy Saturday night; the wine and champagne list is abundant; the steak is absolutely the best we have had (aged, bone-in filet).  The beet salad is outstanding.  Atmosphere is lively and loud (no music is played in the restaurant, just lots of voices and laughter).  There are numerous tables and a sprinkling of booths that line one wall that look out at the tables.  Atmosphere is not over the top fancy, but comfortable."
04/23/2016,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"The saltiest steak ive ever had. My brothers and I tried to take our father out to a nice birthday dinner...it didnt go so hot.  We all ordered diffierant cuts of steak,  but each one was extremely over salted.  I'm talking that burning of the lips kind of salty 


Extremely disappointed"
04/22/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"My husband and I like to have dinner at Michael Jordan's when we go to Mohegan sun.  The food is always amazing.. We look forward to an intimate dinner with elegant food. The wine list is very nice, we always try something new and there is always new and fun appetizers on the menu, we had garlic bread with a creamy Gorgonzola sauce.. It was terrific. Followed by the best steaks!! We go there all the time and recommend it to everyone we talk to!!"
04/22/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Great Restaurant i took my wife too, the food was the best, i had the crab cake best crab cake i ever had."
04/22/2016,OpenTable Diner,3.0,The food was pretty delicious....but not more delicious than anywhere I've ever been.  Far from it! Not worth the $300 bill for just 2 of us to eat.
04/17/2016,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Nice restaurant but not for the middle working class. Too expensive.
04/17/2016,TRdiningout,5.0,"Everything was excellent! The food the ambiance, the staff was the best! We look forward to our next visit"
04/15/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Everything we tried was phenomenal! The presentation and the flavors, the creativity in the menu selections, and the wine/ drinks were each worth every penny! We look forward to the next visit."
04/15/2016,ChrisG,4.0,We used to a very good to great restaurant costing between $50-75 per person with wine. Our experience here was $200 plus tip. Careful not to order too many apps & sides as each are a meal in themselves (and priced accordingly). Crab cakes are 100% crab and delicious! We left stuffed to the gills and happy as clams sans mucho denero!
04/15/2016,CTfamily,5.0,Hubby said best steak he's ever had - and he is a picky steak eater. I agree!
04/13/2016,jendee,5.0,The best birthday dinner ! Loved everything from the staff to the fresh fruit and candle they brought me for desert!
04/11/2016,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Unfortunately we wont go back. Our $92.00 Porterhouse for 2 could have been alot better.
04/10/2016,TammyT,5.0,We have been here quite a few times and are always completely satisfied with our experience.  The only thing different this time is we got the French fries instead of the mac and cheese and it seemed the portion of the fries was not enough for two people.  Other than that we love the food and will continue to come back!
04/10/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Fantastic service. Food was perfectly prepared and was delicious
04/09/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,An excellent steakhouse in a tourist spot. Exuberant surroundings and expert service. Prices were quite high even for a steakhouse. Dinner for 2 with tip in excess of $180!
04/09/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Four dinners, two ordered steaks, both were awesome. Two ordered Lobster Special. Not so special! Lobsters were halfed and left the dinner to pull it apart. All plates were barren, just entree and no color or plate decoration."
04/09/2016,Sknmnmary,5.0,"The service was excellent,  and the food,  although pricey, was very good.   The Ribeye and the Sirloin on the Bone was phenomenal as well as the Macaroni and Cheese.   Definitely make a reservation or expect to wait, but worth it.   The only fault was it's very noisy in there so not a place if you're looking for romantic."
04/08/2016,SemperFi,4.0,"My wife and I split a salad and MJ's always does it nicely on 2 plates - as we can't eat the single serving - too much!
Had the bacon appetizer for the first time - Incredible!
Had the crab cake appetizer for my meal - Incredible!
The amount of crab was like nothing I have ever had!!
The wine list is great, especially the Spanish and French wine selections."
04/07/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,We were disappointed cuz ran out of the pasta dish he had order the salter chx my husband thought he should have not been charged for his meal if he couldn't have the dish he wanted
04/07/2016,Geoff,3.0,"I was there for a business dinner. 

Unless you MUST go here, save your money. Server Jen was the highlight, pleasant and fast. Food was bland, my filet had zero taste. 

Way overpriced, my 7oz steak was $40!!! And it was broiled not grilled!  And my Cabernet was $25 a glass. 

This isn't NY folks...

Noise was off the charts, we could not hear each other talking at a 2 top...

Go elsewhere..."
04/07/2016,Delicious,4.0,"Came here before a show; food was great.  We had shrimp cocktail and Nueske's bacon for apps, then I had the NY strip and my boyfriend had the KC ribeye. Both steaks were perfectly medium rare and delicious. We had the mashed potato sampler-all were good, but the smoked Gouda was amazing. All in all a great experience and meal."
04/05/2016,regular,3.0,"We ordered our steaks medium rare + (which is how the best steakhouse in Texas recommends them), but our steaks came out medium well and medium. They fixed the problem which is good but the flavor was not as good as we had there previously.  And as I was reviewing the bill when it came, out wait person was walking by and saw me looking over the bill...she stopped/came back and said, ""Oh, I don't know if they took off the first two steaks.""  I found that interesting. I told them that no, they did not take them off...a $100 error...but they fixed it. The overall experience was just okay."
04/03/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Went to MJs Steak House to celebrate my two friends' birthdays.  The staff there was welcoming and very attentive throughout our dinner, especially our server Adrian.  Pretty good ambience and vibe with the location within the Mohegan Sun Casino.  Each of us had a different steak selection and we were all satisfied with our cut of meat and that they were cooked to our liking.  We ordered the asparagus and baked potato sides which were sufficient quantity for the three of us.   Also ordered three different desserts that were very tasty too.  We had a couple of drinks each and did not order any wine.  The bill was over $110 per person not including the tip.  I would come back here for a special occasion or if I was doing well in the casino.  Otherwise, you might consider some of the less pricey dining establishments on the premises.  Your bill might be lower, but I don't think you will find a finer steak dinner than what you would get at MJs.  Be sure to make a reservation days in advance, especially if there is a show at the arena or major event at the casino."
04/02/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We had a wonderful time when we dined at Michael Jordan's! We sat in a cozy booth that kept gave us some privacy to really enjoy the romantic dinner. The food was outstanding and the steak was cooked beautifully. I highly recommend the garlic bread appetizer. All staff are pleasant. Definitely worth the money, will be going again!"
04/02/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Overall, everything was great!  Steaks and sides were perfect!"
04/02/2016,BillI,5.0,"Doesn't get any better than MJ's at Mohegan Sun. Best food, best service!"
04/01/2016,JoseT,3.0,"On our recent visit to MJ steak house at Mohegan Sun, Coneticut ,a party of 4 steak loving and  hearty appetite guys were greeted with Luke warm ,Sam Adams Summer ale beer. On request of a cold beer we were told that's the way it comes from the tap and that maybe the glass can be chilled for us on our next round. Stoping any further beer issues we stuck with soda and  water after one beer. I would never  recommend anyone order a beer here. I am also further amazed  at steak house prices and steak house reputations something that even a no frills establishment will never fail yet MJ's steak house grossly fails followed by a disappointing attempt to correct. 

However, we were there for a nice steak dinner. As usual with any steak house we had a magnificent dinner. 
Oysters (outstanding), garlic bread ( decent at most definitely not deserving of the rave), glazed bacon ( outstanding) mushroom bisque (outstanding), crab cakes (outstanding) Delmonico steak (outstanding) wagyu beef (unbelievable how amazing it is) creamed spinach (outstanding), mushrooms (outstanding), mash potatoes sampler (outstanding), chopped salad (outstanding) 

As you can see if a outstanding meal soda and cold water is what you want then MJ's steak house is great. I didn't try any other bar drinks after a poor attempt with my first bar drink. Since we stopped any further disappointments I rated at 3 stars other wise 1 star would have been more than sufficent. 

A 5 star would have been given with cold beers and a real garlic bread not toasted bread with a cream dipping sauce and dessert that was skipped due to the warm beer.

I hope my reviews was helpful. I would like to return but will have to consider other restaurants at Mohegan sun before."
03/26/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"my husband and I visited Michael Jordan's steakhouse for our 1 year anniversary. The hostess was very pleasant, and knowledgeable with offering suggestions for dinner. The food was delicious, and more than enough. We were given a complimentary chocolate cupcake with cheese cream frosting for dessert, and it was delicious too. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends and family, and we will definitely return."
03/26/2016,Irma,2.0,"My reservation for a booth was not honored.  Our waitress seemed to be more interested in talking to the maître'  instead of serving food.  Our appetizers arrived in a haphazard way to each diner, some felt like they were sitting around awhile.  Luckily, the lovely steaks were served together and were delicious as usual. After that again our waitress just always seemed in a rush and that we were taking up her time.  As we left we saw what her time was taken up with at the front, conversing with guess who?  Sorry to say, we do not want to repeat this experience!"
03/25/2016,dawnm,5.0,A wonderful restuarant!!  We loved everything about it...
03/25/2016,Hav2eat,5.0,"As usual the service, food and atmosphere was excellent!!!"
03/20/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Food was amazing as always didn't even need a knife the steak was so tender. Service was a little slow but it was a busy Saturday night . As to be expected.
03/19/2016,OpenTable Diner,3.0,We come here every time we go to mohegansun love the food always get the same side dishes was a little disappointed this time around. The lobster mashed potatoes was filled with shells and the lobster was way overcooked you had to scrape the meat out of the shell with that it had pieces of shell in our shredded lobster. I love the ambience of your restaurant but maybe in your booths you can add a little more lighting you can hardly see the menu!
03/19/2016,Cas9,5.0,"We celebrated a birthday here.  The service was excellent!  It was very busy, but we never felt rushed. The food was better than the last time we ate here.  The mushroom and onion side dish was outstanding and went really well with the filet mignon.  They had many choices for sauces on the steak.  We chose the balsamic ginger, which was delicious.  The other entree, the scallops, was also quite good.  If you enjoy salads, the chopped salad with avocado dressing was also delicious.  We will definitely eat here again!"
03/15/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Arrived for our reservation and were seated immediately. When I made the reservation I mentioned it was our 41st Anniversary and there was a card at the table recognizing  that and we were immediately served complimentary champagne. The service by everyone on the staff was excellent and attentive to all of or needs. My wife had the special and commented to our server about getting the recipe from the chef. The chef came to our table and discussed the sauce he had made with my wife and after sharing how to make it asked if she would like a small container to take home which he went straight to the kitchen and got for her. It was certainly not in-expensive but well worth every penny. I highly recommend this for any couple that wants a full service experience.
03/13/2016,LisaH,4.0,Very good steak . A little price but worth it. Nice staff great service
03/13/2016,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"Don't know how the service was, the staff kept passing on our reservation for walk-ins. Will NEVER go back. Left there and went to Bobby Flay's BarAmericain better atmosphere and food."
03/12/2016,Linda,3.0,"We started we classic Caesar salads, lettuce was nice and crisp.  Side dishes ordered were steamed spinach & hand cut fries with truffle Parmesan.  We were excepting the same type of truffle fries that we've had in England we were wrong.  Ribeye was ordered as well as a America Wagyu sirloin.  The ribeye was dry and no flavor.  The sirloin was good but on the smaller side.  Pumpkin Martin is very good.  We do have to say our server was excellent.  Unfortunately we will not be visiting again as we feel the quality has dropped over time."
03/11/2016,Mjc019cop,4.0,Food always well prepared and attentive service staff.
03/11/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We enjoyed this resteraunt very much.The service was great, yery friendly. The new york strip steak I had was by far the best I ever had, cooked exactly the way I ordered it. My girlfriend ordered the Filet Mingon and it too was cooked perfectly and both steakes were so tender you could almost cut them with your fork. Thank you for a really geat dinner and a fine experience."
03/10/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The service was excellent and the portions of the entrees and sides were generous. My only criticism is that the sirloin was ""chewy"" and made me regret having not ordered the filet mignon."
03/08/2016,bbandjb,5.0,"I ate at the bar.  The filet mignon was excellent, as was the beet salad.  Good wine choices as well."
03/07/2016,JZIII,3.0,"Experience was not memorable, tuna tar tar was good, oysters were good, service was lacking overall. I've eaten at numerous top steak houses in the country and they all slice the poterhouse tableside. It was disappointing when it came out already cut with the bone sticking up like a christmas tree."
03/06/2016,KerriK,4.0,The Garlic bread w/fondue is delicious!
03/02/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Awesome dinner and service excellent. Love this place
03/01/2016,HonestAnnie,2.0,"We began dinner with cold seafood platter for around $69.  There were 5 small oydters,5 small clams,half of a tiny lobster tail & a part of a claw,a pile of  mystery seafood which might have been crab in  another life,and 6 shrimp. The wedge salad was covered with dressing that wss supposed  to be blue cheese. Steak was okay but nothing special."
02/29/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Food was excellent, service was spot on and everyone there made our dining experience fantastic. We will be back. Thanks to all"
02/28/2016,MaryC,3.0,"The menu is over-priced and portions are small. My out-of-town guests said the $10 baked potato was better than the $60 steak. Four scallops for $38 is a disgrace. This is an appetizer size, not an entrée. The sangria tasted like pure alcohol, no flavor. I don't plan on going back again. If I do, I'll order the potato.  On a positive note, our server was wonderful. The service is very good and accommodating."
02/27/2016,John,3.0,"Basically... I was just bored.  Going to MJ's for dinner should be a high point, right?  Not so much.  The fillet, while an extremely tender piece of meat, was not all it could have been.  No char... No juice to speak of (cooked it medium rare) just a hunk of beef on a plate.  The funniest thing is that the best part of the meal were the rolls.  Imagine... One 10oz fillet with a side of mashed potatoes and a ceasar salad with a bottle of Pinot Grigio for $175.00 but we only talked the rolls.  What a shame."
02/26/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,My wife and I sat in a booth off to the side and it was great to avoid some of the noise and traffic.   The service from Jules our waitress was fantastic and the food was top notch.  I had to hold back from gnawing on the bone from my filet!  Great dining experience overall.
02/26/2016,Michelle,4.0,"While our booth was awesome including throw pillows, the lobster tail came out almost glued to the shell and cold and the three sample mashed potatoes were room temperature--everything else was great.  After being here, here now four times, it was really disappointing...especially since we were one of the first customers in the restaurant :("
02/23/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Had an excellent experience at Michael Jordan's steakhouse. Service was outstanding our waitress Jules was perfect and was very knowledgeable a blessing when it came to the menu. The food was one of the best meals I've ever had. I would definitely come back!
02/21/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Excellent choice to celebrate 2 steak-loving friend's birthdays. We were promptly seated after arriving late 1/2 hr: greeted and seated with a smile. Our waitress Melissa was a gem, very cordial: she took our drink orders and inquired if this was our first time visiting. I told her 'no', but it has been over 2 years since the last visit; we were here today to celebrate both of my friend's birthdays. She introduced Nate, her busboy, as he filled our water glasses: then explained that they have updated their menu a few months ago and proceeded to clarify, followed by giving us the 'specials'. In the past, I've found the steaks to be above average, sides were good, service average, overall experience to be: average because of the ambiance / noise. I remembered they had this ""Cowboy Steak"" and asked what was comparable...Melissa quickly said the bone-in ribeye was it. Anyway, the Waygu beef meatball appetizer was delicious, slightly on the spicy side for me but perfect for the friend that ordered it. Chopped salad was shared by myself and friend. The 2 rib eyes were perfection and filet mignon was like butter. Mac & Cheese side was heaven (highly recommended ), had to order another and asparagus was cooked to perfection. Never had to ask for water or fight with clutter at the table. Melissa and Nate was very attentive, followed by a visit from Amanda, the manager, to check on things....all very professional, what an exceptional dinner service. At the end of the meal, we were pleasantly surprised with 2 chocolate birthday cakes that arrived with candles...attention to details; Melissa's inquiries weren't just small talk. A bit pricey but when the food and service was that exceptional, it was worth the money. Moderately busy, noise can be somewhat distracting but tolerable."
02/20/2016,ac2496,3.0,"I had a decent experience here. Since it's a celebrity steakhouse I wASN'T expecting groundbreaking food, so I won't bother to compare it to NYC steakhouses. The sides were very good, especially the garlic bread fondue. The steak (porterhouse for 2) was not worth the $90+ price tag, nor were any of the wines. The dessert we had was good but again, not great, and the description was not accurate (we ordered it for the gummy bear reduction, and there was none).
Go here if you don't mind blowing some money (you are in a casino after all) but not if you want something great."
02/18/2016,bonogirl1015,3.0,"Our server was very professional and friendly but after we ordered our salad and entrees she asked us if we would like garlic bread, regular bread or a mix of both. We chose garlic bread and were charged $10 for the appetizer garlic bread!!! (which we never would have ordered because blue cheese puree was poured all around it on the plate and neither of us like blue cheese) Since we had bread plates we wrongly assumed the garlic bread was complimentary. I heard our server say to the party next to us ""would you like the garlic bread from the menu..."" when she offered them bread, which she did not say to us, otherwise we would not have ordered it. They opted for ""a little of both"" so I wonder what they were charged. My husband's wagyu sirloin was good but my 7 oz filet was so salty I could barely eat half. Our Caesar salad was very good."
02/16/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The restaurant was filled to capacity, yet the service never lacked. We began our meal with our favorites -  garlic bread w/blue cheese fondue appetizer and caesar salad. The chateaubriand and lobster tails were cooked to perfection.  When I want creamed spinach, this is where I dine.  The spinach is actually crispy, yet it is cooked well.  We had the short bread crusted apple pie for dessert, a little slice of heaven!  This meal,  accompanied with a Merryvale Cabernet took us, ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow!"""
02/15/2016,Sweeneyct,5.0,"I continue to have a problem with the hostess.  She checks you in from open table and if you find a seat near the bar (and decide to sit there) she cancels your reservation.  this makes it look (to open table) that you were a ""no show"" (and you don't get your points, but still dined there).
Otherwise, this place is great!"
02/13/2016,jones,5.0,Took my date out for our first Valentine's Day weekend and wanted to really make it very special for us. Michael Jordan's steakhouse was just the place I was looking for. The food was delicious and reasonably priced
02/13/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Had an excellent dinner at Michael Jordan's to celebrate Valentine's Day!  The food was delicious and what impressed me most was how fast dinner was served.  Even though we were not in a rush, it was nice to have some extra time after dinner to enjoy the rest of the casino.  It was a wonderful evening!"
02/07/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The service was impeccable, the crab cake was THE BEST crab cake I have ever had. The steak as always was cooked to perfection. What a great way to celebrate with my husband!"
02/07/2016,IJNK,4.0,Little bit pricey for what you get
02/07/2016,Gianna,5.0,"Everything was amazing. Delicious cocktails! Ugh that pretzel like bread!!! YUM. didn't have appetizers wanted to leave room for steak and it definitely didn't disappoint. We Had the bone in rib eye, filet mignon, and the lobster dish for our pescatarean. All three were amazing. Steak cooked perfectly. Aged rib eye was absolutely delicious!!! Service was amazing! Our waitress even went above and beyond and found out what time Sephora downstairs closed for us so we wouldn't miss out on our plan to go there after dinner. I wish I could remember here name to mention it here. We were there on Saturday the 6th at 8:30 pm if the restaurant wants to look her up. She's the reason I even feel I MUST review. I don't think I would eat anywhere else on my next visit to Mohegan Sun. Can't wait to go back."
02/06/2016,Michelel,2.0,"6:00 dinner reservation, restaurant was moderately busy.

We ordered the 10 oz. Filet Mignon ($46). We ordered it medium, it came out medium-well to well done.

We ordered the 2 lb. lobster ($55, the waitress highly recommended it), it couldn't have been more than 4-5 oz. of meat total. It was way overcooked and chewy. 

I ordered a Bourbon (Bakers) & Coke, they charged me $15 for the bourbon and $2.95 for the Coke.

The baked potato ($10) was average at best.

The bread was really good.

Our waitress Jules was really excellent."
02/06/2016,DonaldG,2.0,Nice spot good food and excellent service
02/06/2016,OpenTable Diner,3.0,It was good...food was good...great service...the wait staff was wonderful
02/05/2016,Debrapal,4.0,"Nice environment. Excellent, excellent service. Fairly Expensive ala carte menu. High quality steaks and ample size sides.  We did the porterhouse for 2 and enjoyed both the quality and presentation.  Not likely to return; value for price not there."
02/05/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food was amazing! The carmalized sea scallops melted in my mouth. The steak was cooked to perfecting! Smoked corn off the cob was perfectly seasoned and the barley with root vegetables was also amazing
02/01/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We enjoyed eating at the steakhouse food was delicious will go again the next time we are at Mohegan sun. Prices were good. Service was friendly.
01/31/2016,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"My steak was well done when I asked for medium, I wasn't pleased with the food but the waitress was awesome"
01/30/2016,OpenTable Diner,3.0,The food was amazing but was far to busy and packed the tables were on top of each other . Reception was rude and was 15 minutes late getting us to our table
01/30/2016,Flowers,3.0,Everything at restaurant was good except the noise level.  We were seated at a table for Two near the bar and we couldn't even hear each other talking the noise was so loud.  A couple was seated right next to us and within 10 minutes demanded to be seated elsewhere because of the noise.  Kind of upsetting since we spent $200 + on dinner and couldn't even have a conversation.
01/30/2016,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"The host was extremely rude. He spoke to us in very condescending tones. We originally booked for 2 people. Then changed it over the phone to 4 people. The next day Rachel called us and politely confirmed 4 people. The host told us he only had 2 people. And when we told him about Rachel, he told us that there is no Rachel here and was very very rude about it. We showed him the message on the phone and after he read it, he said that it didn't matter because he had a table for 4 anyway. No apologies, no eye contact, just plain condescending."
01/30/2016,Sweeneyct,5.0,"Been here a few times, solid food and service, every time."
01/30/2016,PMCM,4.0,"We both had tenderloin it was excellent wine was good and service was outstanding
Can't wait to go back!"
01/30/2016,Molly,4.0,"Service and food are always excellent.  I do, however,  have one complaint.  I dislike immensely when we are still eating our first course to have our main course brought out to us.  This has happened on several visits to your restaurant.  Spending money on a great meal is not a problem but not giving us at least a minimum of five minutes to sit and relax in-between courses is.  Your staff is overly attentive and extremely polite.  The complaint is not about them but about the timing.  If you would improve that one aspect of your restaurant I would't have a complaint at all.  Overall your restaurant is one of the best."
01/30/2016,DianeD,5.0,"My husband and I go  to Michael Jordan's  since we are steak lovers.
During the week the restaurant is great. On the weekend expect it to be noisy.
However the food is delicious.
We'll keep going!"
01/26/2016,Great,5.0,The service was terrific and my martini was perfect!
01/23/2016,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Service was great. Prices were outrageous for the amount of food offered. Steak dishes were very good and also very tiny at an average cost of $50 per plate. Everything is  la carte so that adds to the already steep bill. Side dishes and appetizers were unimpressive and really not enough quantity to share. I would recommend this but only for an extremely special occasion and as a 1 time must try. I had my one time so I will not return.
01/19/2016,dannyboy,4.0,We like dining here. Our waiter was extremely nice...even a little over the top.  MJ's is very pricey but the food quality is almost worth it. Split a Caesar salad...very large and good. Waiter really pushed the new menu item....bone in filet....it was fine but I still like the ribeye better. Wife enjoyed her scallops. rolls are delicious. no complaints.
01/19/2016,Bday2747,5.0,"We enjoyed our birthday dinner tremendously but we were given an appetizer unexpectedly and believed it was complementary.  It was not and were charged for it.
 We had already ordered two appetizers and ate them.  
The garlic bread was enjoyable but I find this an unacceptable practice.  We did not argue the order at the end because we truly enjoyed our waitress and tipped her accordingly which was over 25%."
01/18/2016,SaraZ,3.0,Very expensive. Items are a la carte.
01/18/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Food,Service,and Ambiance wonderful, especially for a special night, however the night we went was crowded and acoustics were awful couldn't hear each other without raising our voices.  Glad to go back but not if it's crowded-i.e. ours was a holiday weekend with an arena show"
01/18/2016,MargeM,5.0,Would not hesitate to go back there.  The waiters and waitresses were professional and the food was wonderful
01/17/2016,tuscanyfan,5.0,"Best steak anywhere. Roasted chicken is outstanding. Baked potato is huge and easily feeds two. Would like a small side salad which is not available. Rolls buttery and hot. 
It is our favorite restaurant at Mohegan Sun."
01/17/2016,Sher,4.0,Everything was really wonderful but the noise level was a bit much and it would be nice to have some cozy spots for 2 people. The food was totally amazing the drinks where great no complaints really. We will come again.
01/17/2016,Kerri,5.0,Outstanding!! A nice relaxing atmosphere. Service was amazing !! Food was great!!
01/16/2016,SemperFi,4.0,"Again MJ's come through with good service,good food and a great wine!"
01/16/2016,Dbruc,4.0,"The appetizers were excellent.  The salads were wonderful. The steak was fantastic. The side dishes were.... Eh. I love good food and do not mind paying for it, but I hate a la carte dining when a mediocre potato is $10. I would rather the cost be absorbed into the entree price."
01/16/2016,ATLV,5.0,"I would recommend checking out this restaurant.  There is a sports bar right next door, so this is an easy miss.  The decor was mondern, the food was tasteful and the service was incredible."
01/15/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Food was delicious and cooked to perfection! Service was friendly and knowledgeable!!
01/15/2016,Dawn,5.0,"Where else can you go to get that ""BACON"" and not to mention Baked Alaska and the drinks.  Everything was amazing.  Wish there was one closer to home!"
01/12/2016,VB1947,5.0,Excellent filet mignon. Everything is al a carte so it get to be expensive but the food and service make up for the high prices. It was our anniversary so they gave us complimentary Champagne-nice touch!
01/10/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Waitress was excellent, food was outstanding as usual. Excellent choice of coctails and wine list. We love the restaurant. Unfortunately, the ever-skyrocketing prices have relegated it to special occasions for us."
01/09/2016,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The Michael Jordan's restaurant is the perfect setting for any occasion. Friendly and professional staff, nice atmosphere and outstanding food.  It can get a little noisy and some tables are a bit too close. Yet, this is my second time there and won't be my last. I do recommend this establishment to everyone."
01/09/2016,MrB46,5.0,What a great dinner experience. Food was fantastic and the waiter was really attentive.
01/08/2016,geeb,3.0,"My ribeye was delicious and cooked perfectly, as well as the petite filet that my husband ordered.  We also enjoyed the blue cheese fondue/garlic bread and the tuna tartare appetizers.  My steak arrived while we were still enjoying the appetizer, despite the server's assurance that the meal would be appropriately delivered.  Felt rushed, didn't have wine ready to go with the steak.  The server was also surprised when everything came out before we were ready.  Other than that, the food was delicious."
01/08/2016,CharlesG,5.0,"We have eaten at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse numerous times. While some may consider it expensive you surely get your monies worth. My husband compares all other restaurants to Michael Jordan's when ordering lamp chops; no one compares. The filet mignon melts in your mouth and to use salt and pepper would be an insult to the chef; it is always wonderful. There is always a nice selection of wines as well as whether you want a glass, half bottle or bottle. The after dinner drinks are wonderful as well."
01/04/2016,KatrinaG,5.0,"Great food, outstanding service.  Worth the price."
01/04/2016,brucej,5.0,a quiet sunday night with another couple.    all food was prepared perfectly with a lot of taste and the tastes were great.    can't remember  servers name but she was excellent.
01/03/2016,Pavs,5.0,"We went for a late New Years celebration. The lobster corn chowder was very good, my fiance's steak he loved cooked perfectly.  I had the halibut which was very good. I always am skeptical about ordering fish at steakhouse b/c it's often screwed up.( FYI I'm a pescaterian) The Halibut was cooked perfect with a corn relish that complimented it great.  All in all were very pleased as we have been in the past. Oh and they bought my fiance a birthday cupcake we didn't order he was happy we laughed!"
01/02/2016,SemperFi,4.0,"Haven't been to MJ's Steak house in a very long time as we don't eat meat that often. After looking at a recent menu we noticed a nice selection of seafood! Went last weekend had a great meal and great service! As we can't eat as much as we use to, we often share our meal. The kitchen split our salad for us which is a class act, especially in a higher priced venue. (Some restaurants will even split our entrée!)
Will absolutely go again!"
01/02/2016,OpenTable Diner,4.0,My wife and I decided to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary at MJ's restaurant.  We were both very pleased with the outstanding service but most importantly the food was amazing. My only wish was that our window seat would be a little-more spread apart from the next few couples tables. Didn't like it when I was able to hear the nearby conversations. Essentially I will be visiting MJ's restaurant on my next visit to mohegan Sun.
01/02/2016,DavidR,5.0,"The garlic bread with blue cheese fondue was absolutely to die for. Probably one of the best apetizers I have ever had.

The steaks were spot on as we ordered and melt in your mouth delicious. The service as expected in a restaurant of this caliber and great sense of humor too. 

Definitely a must!!!"
01/02/2016,Louisg,3.0,"the sides were not very good lobster mac and cheese was 29$ no lobster to thick not flavorful
creamed spinach bland no flavor"
01/01/2016,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Table we sat at was in an awkward location next to where all the waiters and waitresses come in and out, that table should not exist there , food was great like usual and vibe was great."
12/31/2015,Linda,3.0,"Normally service is impeccable with steaks that melt in your mouth.  I think with it being New Years Eve the service was lacking as well as the quality.  Our server came to check on us once and when our steaks arrived, but we were almost done; no one asked if they were cooked to our liking.  For the amount that is paid per steak, you would expect more from this restaurant.  The delmonico staek their signature steak was not as flavorful as it normally is."
12/31/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Defiantly a 5 star resturant, they really put a lot of thought in detail from the food to the atmosphere. Never a bad meal, I will continue to recommend this place."
12/29/2015,Staz,5.0,We had an amazing meal at Michael Jordans...best steak I've ever had! WI'll definitely return.
12/29/2015,SteakandWineLover,4.0,"The filet minion melted in your mouth and have a nice char on the outside (requested and served medium rare). Very good flavor.  Creamed spinach could have used a little less garlic and a touch of nutmeg. Grilled asparagus was a little woody but was cooked well. Highly recommend the garlic bread appetizer with the blue cheese sauce.  Raw oyster appetizer was also very good,however the oysters were a little on the small side. The wine list is very extensive and overpriced compared to a restaurant ""premium multiplier"" over retail cost. It was work to fine relatively good value wines on the wine list. The atmosphere is not very  romantic and a little industrial and better suited for groups.  The restaurant should put up some fabric panel dividers to make it more intimate and a better ""feel"".  Service was attentive and overbearing nor were there any blatant attempts to up sell."
12/26/2015,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"Totally down hill. Overpriced, stale, rushed. Horrible meal. Never again."
12/25/2015,RIgambler,4.0,"Awesome bone rib-eye steak in the class of Ruth's Chris in terms of meat, preparation and presentation!"
12/25/2015,HediM,5.0,"We were seated quickly after arriving. Our waitress was friendly, she took time explaining specials for the evening. Appetizers and dinner were properly spaced, we did not feel rushed. we shared two appetizers which arrived separately since one was the roasted beet salad the other steak tartar.Everything was well seasoned..no salt or pepper shakers on the table needed.Noise levels were low, we could hear what was said at the table. Sure will go back."
12/21/2015,OpenTable,5.0,"We were celebrating our wedding anniversary. Our waiter Chris, was very helpful and knowledgeable. We went with his recommendations and were extremely pleased. At the bar we we served by Adrienne, and she was very pleasant. We will return on our next stay at Mohegan Sun."
12/18/2015,OpenTable Diner,3.0,It was my third time at MJs steak house. The first two times were great which I why I went back. On my most recent visit my food wasn't very hot and steak was full of fat. I was expecting a little bit better!
12/18/2015,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"So I have been here before, and came back.
All in all, the meal was only ok. but the great service made up for it.
The apps and sides were great. My Delmonico steak, not so much. over half fat.
Waitress brought it back to the chef, who said it was fatty even for the cut.
They gave us out bottle of wine for free to make up for it.
(to the point, I did not complain or demand compensation, just asked if it was normal to be that fatty, and if I made ma mistake in not asking before ordering)
they went above and beyond service wise, and that will make me go back again"
12/17/2015,OpenTable Diner,2.0,very disappointing/  The Michael Jordan in the city much better.  I shared a rib eye steak with my husband.  Not a very tender steak.  very disappointing.  I also sent the potatoe back.  It was not thoroughly cooked.  The whole meal should have bee much better.  Would not recommend this to anyone
12/13/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The special bone-in filet mignon was fantastic!! Sides terrific and the best baked Alaska dessert ever. Left stuffed and happy! Service also outstanding. This was our second visit and it was just as good as the first. We will be back for a third!
12/13/2015,SpaGirls,4.0,"We were seated in a large plush booth, per our request . Enjoyed Martini's .  Filet Mignons were wonderful as was the beet salad, the lobster mac and cheese etc.
the waiter was wonderful and accommodating."
12/12/2015,Datenight,5.0,"This dinner experience was part of an overnight romantic get away.  I appreciated that we were seated toward the back of the restaurant away from noise, crowds, young children and any hustle and bustle.  Seems these folks had the good sense not to put large parties near tables that where just couples.  It was obvious to me that thought went into were parties were seated and how guests were brought into the dining room.  Kudos to them.  Wait staff was very attentive, food was very good.  The meal was pricey but I guess you get what you pay for.  Can't afford to do this every week but certainly I will be back.  Overall a very nice dining experience."
12/10/2015,ChristmasWinterAngel22255,3.0,"too expensive, too noisy, two little Christmas trees for decoration.     Shouldn't ask if you want water and should give you a piece of bread for that price."
12/10/2015,Birthday09,4.0,"Overall experience was very good.  My only suggestion is a tastier piece of cake when a customer mentions they are their celebrating his/her birthday, which I was celebrating that night.  I understand that if you mention it's your birthday, the slice of cake is free, but it tasted like a chocolate boxed pound cake and I was a little disappointed.  Maybe a piece of cake off the normal dessert menu would of been nice.  Thanks."
12/09/2015,Maureen,5.0,Always a great dinner.  Don't miss the blue cheese garlic bread!  Also crab cake is the best around!
12/07/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Located in Mohegan Sun Casino Hotel, this is a great option for dining.  Always a great steak and the blue cheese fondue is a MUST have.  Highly recommend to anyone dining at the casino."
12/06/2015,Donna,4.0,"Our server Chris was wonderful, very knowledgable about the food and wine. He made our evening much more enjoyable. The only distraction was the noise level but it was a very trendy place with high ceilings."
12/02/2015,hg123,2.0,I ordered a medium well pink center filet. I explained in depth that I did not want a well done steak. I got a well done steak. I didn't have time to return it and it cost $50.
11/30/2015,CesarSalad,5.0,Great service. Good food. Steaks and Cesar's salad was wonderful. Baked Alaska was delicious. Fab Martini.
11/28/2015,KarenP,5.0,"Justin kept our water cool and crisp, Chris was a joy, and Ryan was a delight and super helpful.  5 of 5; would come again.  Our compliments to the chef!"
11/28/2015,Alt238,4.0,"While we were seated later than our reservation, once seated our service was slow.  When finally waiter appeared, he was polite and professional.  Food was perfect. Atmosphere was very nice and the wine selection is good.  This is our third time at MJ's and other than the slow service, I believe this is a great value for such excellently prepared dishes.  I hope next time we can be seated within half an hour of our reservation time.  I have never had this problem at any of the other establishment at Mohegan Sun."
11/27/2015,TRdiningout,5.0,Great service and food and wine!! A very enjoyable evening out! Highly recommended!
11/27/2015,Oysters,5.0,Great food. Arrived in timely manner and hot. No problem to return a steak that was not cooked properly.
11/27/2015,Pam06905,4.0,The steak was cooked to perfection. The service was great. Note to anyone going to Mohegan - book a reservation early or be prepared to dine at 5 PM.
11/26/2015,DeeB,5.0,"My husband and I dined in on a Tuesday night, it wasn't our first time. Not disappointed in the food or the service. Our waiter Chris K. told us about the specials and my husband had the Bone-in Filet Mignon, it was the best we ever tasted! I had the surf and turf and the lobster was amazing as well. Chris was wonderful checking on us constantly and we loved his recommendation!
The garlic bread is always a MUST as well! I do not like blue cheese but this was amazing. 
Can't wait to go back!!!"
11/26/2015,Retired,4.0,"I ordered the sea bass and it was not cooked as well done as I like my fish even after 2 attempts.  So the wait staff suggested I order something else if I was not satisfied. The staff assured me they wanted me to be happy with my meal and not to hesitate to ask for something else if I was not happy with my meal.  I ended up with the salmon and it was cooked to perfection for me. Crusty on the outside and still moist on the inside. My husband said the tur-duck-in (Thanksgiving day special) was delicious. However the liquid slightly vinegary cranberry sauce (thin watery) was a huge disappointment. Dessert was a huge apple pie cooked with what tasted like pumpkin pie spices in a cast iron skillet with vanilla ice cream. It was almost too much for two people to eat, almost!"
11/22/2015,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The food was fantastic and the waitress was knowledgeable and helpful. She checked back in with us at regular intervals but was not intrusive. The appetizer, crab cake, was a standout and I would recommend it highly to anyone else. The only negative of the night was the person greeting is. If was obvious she wasn't the designated hostess as she was rude and almost hostile when she greeted us. It was not representative of the overall experience."
11/21/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We were there to celebrate my cousin's birthday and the host and server were outstanding. The garlic bread with the blue cheese fondue is excellent. I never had a steak so tender that you could exactly cut it with a butter knife. Overall, the service and food was delicious."
11/21/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The food was excellent.  Best steak I had and the crab cake was crab not full of breading. The wait staffor did an excellent job.  The food was on the warm side but it could of been a bit more hot.
Overall the experience was a 9 out of 10."
11/20/2015,Babog,4.0,This restaurant is inside a very nice casino environment but is still able to feel like you can step out of the crowds and enjoy a very nice dinner with friends.  We loved the atmosphere inside the restaurant.  I had a “Surf and Turf” and my filet mignon was one of the best I’ve eaten in many years.  The lobster tail was so poorly-prepared I couldn’t get the meat out away from the shell.  Others in our party stayed with the steaks and were very happy.
11/20/2015,None,5.0,On time seating for our pre-concert reservation; excellent service; personable waiter; perfect food.  No rush to flip the table.  An awesome meal with friends.
11/19/2015,Mills,5.0,Was very accommodating in giving us a booth for my birthday!
11/19/2015,jagg,2.0,We enjoy nice restaurants and this place wasnt very good.  I would recommend going to Bobby Flays!  Much better experience.
11/15/2015,Foodiegrl,5.0,"This is one of my all-time favorite restaurants. I've tried the location at Grand Central Terminal and it isn't quite as good as the one at Mohegan Sun. The food and service just seems better here at this location. The garlic bread with blue cheese fondue, nueske's double smoked bacon, and crab cake are among my favorite apps, and you will not be disappointed with any of the steaks. I usually opt not to get add ons to the steak as I think the flavor of the steak itself is too good to be covered up with other flavors. The Baked Alaska is my go-to desert."
11/15/2015,Gnilretsew7911,5.0,"Sensational dinner, excellent service, spectacular night out. Be sure to have the garlic bread!"
11/15/2015,DavidMartin,1.0,"On January 27 , my date and I attended a show at Mohegan Sun and went to Michael Jordans for dinner after the show. The place was dead, empty tables in clear view all over the place. The immature hosts told us to give them a minute. While we were standing there waiting, almost 5 minutes, 3 gentlemen of a different ethnicity came in and were seated promptly. I asked the hosts if we were being discriminated against and they just giggled! We never were seated, they were lucky security wasn't needed to calm me down. I will NEVER go to MJ's again.
RACISM IS ALIVE AND WELL HERE!!
I found out one of the guys taken in front of us was a DJ working somewhere at the casino. I don't effing care!!  Does he patronize the casino as much as I do??? I dine there sometimes 3 nights a week!  
Maybe your hosts could be more professional like the wonderful hosts at Bar Americain."
11/13/2015,jdcap21,5.0,"I was truly shocked at the great service and delicious food. I expected ""good"" but this was excellent! Even our waitress was excellent as she handled my food allergies with grace and showing actual concern. Keep up the great work!"
11/12/2015,JeanneM,3.0,"Our first time there was much nicer then this time, we had reservations since August and were stuck at a small table between two large parties where my chair was literally bumped by everyone who passed , the servers and staff seemed very focused on serving the large parties, we sat at the table ignored for a good ten minutes before our waiter came, he seemed distracted and uninterested , our food was good crab cake excellent , but again not nearly as good as it was last year , so for us a disappointment"
11/11/2015,Oprahny,4.0,We have been to Michael Jordan's Steak Restaurant everytime we visit Mohegan Sun.  This past Tuesday we ordered a Ribeye steak that had so much fat and grizzle that it had to be returned to the kitchen as it was inedible.  I was not offered the ability to return my petite filet mignon and had to eat it cold as I did not want my husband to eat his dinner alone.  We paid a good amount of money for this meal and I must say that based on this experience I would NOT go back nor would I recommend it.  Shame as it use to be very good.
11/11/2015,Jayrot,3.0,"I've been to MJ's a few times now. I always ask for a table in the back part of the dining room. As you walk in you will see how noisy the bar section and front part of the dining room is. It's too loud for a fine steak house like this, especially when there is a MJ's Sports bar and café attached to the steak house. That's where you would expect a loud atmosphere. My issue was, that I asked the hostess for a table in the back away from the noise. She told me they had reservations. The tables were empty and I as well, made a reservation a few weeks before the dinner. Oh well, she sat us in the front section of the dining room and we had to raise our voices to carry on the conversation, with a lot of what? and excuse me? Thank goodness the food is very good, I wouldn't go back if it wasn't"
11/08/2015,KPK21,5.0,"We have been dissatisfied with MJ's ever since Todd Mark Miller was chef and ruined the place. The new Chef Miller (no relation from what I am told) has turned it back around. We had the best filets  Sunday  that we have ever had there. 
The host staff was as welcoming as ever and 
our server, Jules, was her pleasant energetic self and on top of the whole dinner.  
Weeee'rreeeee Baaaaaaack !!"
11/08/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The food was excellent! Steak cooked to perfection and a generous portion! The service was top notch from the hostesses from the moment we entered, the bartenders while we sat at the bar and our server and server helper. Highly recommend!"
11/07/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Before making my reservation, I noticed the prices where a bit high, but I thought I would give it a try.  It was worth every penny.  I had the scallops, and my friend had the steak, and they were both fantastic!!  The side dishes were delicious, and the creamed spinach was possibly the best I ever tasted.  Even the bread was worth writing home about (No need to pay extra for the blue cheese dip appetizer they recommend) In addition, the service was good, and our table was ready as soon as we arrived.  I look forward to go there again!"
11/07/2015,MeatAndPotatoMan,4.0,"Michael Jordan’s Steak House is a very good place for special occasions. Our meal was cooked to perfection. No complaints…then dessert. Because it was my birthday, they offered a free chef’s special dessert. We have had their desserts on past occasions…they are great! This free dessert would have been okay for a diner restaurant, not for an upscale fine restaurant. I would rather have paid for one of their fine desserts or had no dessert at all. The free dessert was a chocolate cupcake with whipped cream and a raspberry on top. It was dry and tasteless.  I would suggest they keep their free desserts."
11/05/2015,Suesmcd,5.0,"We requested a booth via our reservation 3 weeks in advance.  When we arrived we were told it wasn't going to be available, we were bummed but what can you do.  Minutes later the manager came over to us and gave us a booth!  Very romantic evening we had planned so the booth was great.  Waitress was super, meal was great, we will go again."
11/03/2015,MedicJoe,5.0,My wife and I enjoy the high end steak houses that have been a staple at casinos across the country. Michael Jordan's did not disappoint. The service was perfect and the food was delicious. Great job MJ
11/03/2015,Clocker,5.0,My wife and I enjoyed our recent dining experience at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse. The porterhouse steak for two that we shared was perfectly prepared and delicious. The drinks were generous and the Caesar salad and side dishes were excellent. The service was friendly and attentive. We will definitely return to Michael Jordan's during our next visit to Mohegan Sun.
10/31/2015,PoolGuy,5.0,Good time good eats
10/29/2015,KaiM,5.0,We have been here several times and find that the food and staff are always at their best!
10/27/2015,Great,5.0,Great food. Great steak. Great wine. Great service.
10/27/2015,Joseph,5.0,This is by far the best place in the Mohegan Sun. A little pricey but worth it. Food & Service were EXCELLENT!!!
10/25/2015,vman465,5.0,I highly recommend this place! One one my top 2 restaurants ever! This one being number one!
10/24/2015,Cas9,4.0,"We had a nice dinner here.  The service was attentive, though at times it seemed a bit intrusive.  The restaurant was very noisy and busy at the front, but we were seated at a very quiet and comfortable table in the back.  The food was tasty.  The garlic bead fondue was very good, but very rich--lots of butter and melted cheese-- which might be too heavy for some.  We thought it was.  The chicken had some very nice vegetables with it.  The halibut was nicely prepared, though  a bit too salty for our taste.  We skipped dessert and had cappuccino.  It was outstanding."
10/24/2015,Yikes,5.0,"This was our third visit to MJ Steakouse. We were there for my husbands birthday. As we were ready to place our order, the waiter named off the daily specials. He mentioned a surf n turf. We said fine and ordered that. He never mentioned the price but we assumed it would be in line with the rest of the menu. Not the case! That surf n turf for two was $190.00!!! Our total bill came to $247! Normally, we would spend about $150 or so. Our steak was just ok and the lobster tail was a bit undercooked. We both agreed that if we had known the price when the surf n turf was suggested, we wouldn't have ordered it. Lesson learned."
10/23/2015,Rico,5.0,Great food my favorite is the bone in ribeye. Never had a bad experience. Def recommend.
10/23/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Best steak I ever had and the 23 layer cake topped off the meal!  Must go here if you are in town!
10/21/2015,Foodieguy1,4.0,The steak was excellent. The sides fell a bit short. The lump crab cake was excellent along with the fondue bread. Heirloom tomato salad was not very good along with the cream of spinach side. Baked potato side was good. Service was attentive and the ambiance was very nice.
10/18/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Excellent! Everything was superb. This is our new favorite now. We go have dinner everytime we are at Mohegan. Fantastic! Thank you for a perfect meal we truly enjoyed the steaks, creamed spinach, garlic bread with bleu cheese. Looking forward to our next visit!"
10/17/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Best steak ever as well as the sides. I love the lighting - neither to dark or bright , just right. Great ambiance, classy and elegant.  Service is superior."
10/17/2015,Rich,5.0,We celebrated my son's 21 st birthday here at MJ Restaurant. The service was exceptional and the steaks are hands down the best steak I have ever had in my life. The sides were huge and easily split between three which we did. It was very expensive but you pay for what you get! Highly recommend this for a special night out.
10/17/2015,ARSNV2015,5.0,"My wife and I have shared our anniversary dinner here for the past 3 years. The combination of food, friendly service, and atmosphere makes the experience one to remember every time. This is a must visit location for any person that appreciates fine dining at acceptable pricing."
10/17/2015,Meateaters,3.0,"Gathered there for business dinner and food was overall good. The meats were cooked well but need help with their fish/seafood. The tuna tartare was bland and lacking taste. Ordered the grand seafood platter ($125+) and it was the saddest looking platter with 2 lobster claws, 6 oysters and 10 clams. The crab meat over two pieces of lettuce was completely unseasoned and felt like just opened from a can.  The Delmonico steaks, fillets and the ribeye bone-in were very well cooked and seasoned. Desert disappointed us further :creme brûlée was awful. We sent it back as it was non edible- tastes like uncooked flour. All in all, go for the steaks and order nothing else."
10/16/2015,FoodSnob,5.0,"We had the best drinks, excellent food and the most amazing waiter!  One of the finest dining experiences I have ever had!"
10/16/2015,Corvette,5.0,Michael Jordan's is top notch ! The food is excellent as well as the service. We always order the Tuna Tartare.. soooo good !!  Have never had a bad meal here ! And save room for the Baked Alaska - only place around that serves it !!  Michael's is worth the $$ !
10/14/2015,Williez,4.0,The Caesar salad was tasty and rather large.  My girlfriend's filet was a little on the dry side.  My MJ's ribeye was great.  Fries were very good.  The smoked tomato butter is a very nice touch.  The truffle aoili was excellent with the fries.  Would go there again but would try something other than the filet.
10/10/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Chris, our server was fabulous and very helpful for our special occasion."
10/10/2015,KPDP,5.0,"We visit Mohegan Sun 3-4 times a year for special occasions and have tried many restaurants but nothing ever comes close to the experience that the team at Michael Jordans provides. From the moment you walk in the door to the time you leave, they are top notch. Our service was spectacular which included a visit by the GM to ensure our experience was going well. Although our steaks were great, the highlight of the night was the seafood tower, which we got the large for 4 of us!!"
10/10/2015,PeterM,5.0,Excellent service and food.
10/09/2015,Sue911,5.0,Food was amazing ! Loved it and beautiful decor !
10/09/2015,Anonymous,5.0,"Jimmy is extremely knowledgeable about the menu, offered us very good suggestions, and provided attentive service.  Alverio assisted him with equal attentiveness.  We had a very special and enjoyable evening.  The food was also delicious, with our filets being grilled to perfection.  Cannot wait to go again!"
10/06/2015,DaveG,4.0,"I thought the ambiance was excellent, the service was outstanding, and teh food was good but could have been better.  seemed like everything was a little under seasoned.  Me and my wife both got Filets which were cooked perfect.  The sides were creamed spinach and lobster mac n cheese.  Spinach was pretty good but the mac and cheese was basic elbow pasta with overcooked lobster."
10/03/2015,RoxaneA,4.0,"we love the food and ambiance, but this time we felt they brought the food out too fast.  We loved it but would have liked more time before courses."
09/30/2015,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Somehow the New York strip steak was little burned(ordered medium) & salty.  Service was ok but not special.
09/26/2015,MichaelF,5.0,great steaks
09/20/2015,Gramy,5.0,We visited Mohegan sun for a two day getaway. Michael Jordan's was the perfect spot for a romantic dinner for two.we had surf and turf which was excellent.the wait staff was very friendly and professional. We would definatly recommend you try it.
09/19/2015,Steaklover,5.0,"We went on a very busy saturday night,The service was great,the food was awsome,steaks cooked perfectly,you have to try the bacon appetizer everyone loved it."
09/19/2015,Happy,5.0,"My husband and I both ordered the petite fillet mignon with seasoned butter.We ordered it medium well, just enough pink in the middle to keep it tender and juicy! It  was  done perfectly and so tender. For our sides we shared the grilled corn and the mac & cheese. Their sides are more than generous, enough for 2-3 people to share. Needing something sweet but not heavy after this wonderful meal my husband ordered the mixed berry sorbet.this came topped with some very fresh mixed berries"
09/18/2015,DevonW,4.0,Very nice setting for a friends night out or a date beauty atmosphere and amazing food.
09/14/2015,JimK,5.0,"Been to Michael Jordan's a few times never disappointed. Great staff, nice atmosphere, great steaks nice bar."
09/13/2015,leigh,4.0,I am gluten free and diary free due to allergies not a trend.  I ordered the salmon and understand I can't always have the delicious dish as described in the menu due to my food allergies.  I basically paid 36.00 for a plain piece of salmon on a huge plain white dish.  I think a chef who has any creativity could at least sprinkle some herbs on the fish to make it look like an attempt.  It was very blah and boring.  I've had great results at other restaurants in the same venue with a smaller price point.  I have to say I would not return to MJ's.  I was very disappointed.
09/12/2015,UnicornFarts,4.0,"My husband and I have been to Michael Jordan's Steakhouse twice and have yet to be disappointed. We started with the daily oyster selection but the day we went, they only had one kind of oysters so we got a half dozen. Pretty good but we've had better. I had the Delmonico steak with the Lobster mashed potatoes and asparagus. My husband had the ribeye and the Lobster mashed potatoes. We should have listened to our server, Chris, who said the lobster mashed potatoes would be enough for us to share. Both steaks were cooked perfectly to our preference; my husband medium rare and mine was medium. All in all, not the last time we'll be going to Michael Jordan's Steakhouse."
09/12/2015,TyLeo,5.0,Our Grandson wanted to go to a steak house for his 16th birthday.  We all had a great meal and the steaks we ordered were perfect.  Nice memory for him turning 16.  Service was so good and Jimmy was the perfect waiter.
09/12/2015,Perfect,5.0,Highly recommend.  Everything was perfect.  Our Waiter was wonderful and recommended what I actually.    Very good service and overall experience.  Food was perfect from the side dishes to the steak.  creamed spinach and lobster mashed incredible.  bacon honey glazed appy was also incredible.  Thanks to a good staff.  Very well managed
09/11/2015,KenChar,5.0,Everything from the appetizers to the fantastic porterhouse for 2 was perfect. The service we received was outstanding.
09/11/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We took my husband for his birthday. We had a great time and the food was outstanding. The service by Steve and Jimmy was excellent. I was nervous to go since I am a vegetarian but the chef made an amazingly tasty garlic butter noodle dish with asparagus, 3 kinds of mushrooms, and other veggies- delicious! I made reservations on line and put a note in that it was my husband's birthday. We had a very thoughtful cupcake and candle brought to the table without me even mentioning a word to the staff. We will be back!!!!"
09/11/2015,KatDines2020,3.0,We only go to Michael Jordan's on special occasions due to the high price of the menu. Unfortunately we expected better service and the dessert menu was atrocious. We ordered champagne ice cream and it tasted like sugar water. Our steaks were over priced for what we could find some where else with the same taste and texture. We will probably not go again because it's just not what it use to be. The waiters were nice but too many servers who did not know the menu and we had to wait for answers from the main guy. Oh and the beet salad was not what I expected. It had NO lettuce at all. Wow.
09/11/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Filet mignon was cooked to perfection and delicious. We ordered the roasted corn and side of fries to accompany. Both were amazing. Our waiter was knowledgeable of the menu and very attentive.

I will definitely be returning soon."
09/06/2015,Rob327,5.0,The food and service were awesome.  Looking forward to going again before the end of the year.
09/05/2015,Showtime1,5.0,"This was a first time dinner for my family, as I've dined here twice before.  Everyone enjoyed the special lobster mac and cheese and strip steak, cooked to perfection.  The food was hot and served in a timely manner.  The service was great and my husband said it was better than many of the well known New York steak houses we normally go to. He was as impressed as I was the first few times I ate here.  The prices are moderate and comparable to most steak houses but well worth the visit!"
08/30/2015,tuscanyfan,5.0,"This is the Michael Jordan's at Mohegan Sun.  We have eaten numerous times at  many of the places at the Sun, but avoided MJ's because we are Knick fans! What a mistake. This was easily our best meal at any place we have eaten in a while. The filet was fabulous - cooked  and seasoned perfectly. The one pound baked potato may well have been the best baked potato I have ever had. My wife ate a chicken dinner that she couldn't stop raving about. Not sure we will go to any other restaurant again and are already thinking about how soon we can get back there."
08/30/2015,Ridgetop,5.0,Food was great.  Staff was great.  Great experience.
08/30/2015,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"The steak was over seasoned, and not done well. I was at the restaurant a few weeks prior, and the steak was done perfectly. This time was not consistent with the first."
08/29/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Took my sons for a birthday dinner. Food was outstanding. Service was impeccable. Just totally a great evening. Been here many times. Always outstanding. Chris k the waiter gets 10 stars. Credit to his profession. The bone in filet mignon was the best I ever had.
08/29/2015,OpenTable Diner,2.0,Food was served while all of us had at least half of our salads left   I refused the food at that time and by the time we got it back it was ruined
08/29/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food and service were excellent!! Went above and beyond to make our dinner great
08/29/2015,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Great food, great service ! Way to loud ! Still wonder how such a great service and food presentation resturant could be so loud."
08/27/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Love it as always! Highly recommend this place. Wish I could say the same for their restaurant in NYC.
08/22/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Party of six went out before a concert.  We were seated once we had a majority of the party there. Once seated, the staff was the perfect combination of friendly and distant.  One of the couples we were with was celebrating their anniversary, and they each got a free glass of champagne.  We ordered steaks, chicken, and scallops, as well as sautéed spinach, mushrooms, mashed potatoes, and asparagus as sides. All was delicious.  Salads are huge, so if you're getting one, it's a good idea to split one.  Will definitely come here again!"
08/21/2015,MARKD,5.0,Exceptional steak and lobster mash. Food is always fantastic here.
08/21/2015,Rob327,5.0,We had not been to M.J.'s in over 10 years.  This place is awesome.  Heather our sever was incredible.
08/20/2015,KurtW,5.0,Our dinner here was well worth the price!  The New York strips and side orders of mac/cheese & creamed spinach were delicious and the staff went above and beyond to make my mother's 88th birthday celebration a memorable one. Eat here and you will not be disappointed.
08/19/2015,LiRu,5.0,"I have been to this steakhouse several times and have never been disappointed. Finally, after trying to get my husband there (due to the price tag  $$$$ of meals ) he will definitely be back.
He ordered the filet mignon cooked to perfection and  I ordered the salmon. We were going to the Santana concert so we were a little pressed for time. If we weren't I would have liked him to try the garlic bread appetizer which is excellent. We had the sides of Lobster mashed potatoes and asparagus. Everything was delicious. Monique our waitress was wonderful. The only complaint we have about our table for two was that the table was wobbling. There was already a cloth napkin under one leg which may have come from the person before or the restaurant trying a quick fix which didn't help much. My husband then put his folded up business card under another one to help a little more."
08/19/2015,Medic2,5.0,never fail to have a great meal here. best restaurant in the casino. make a reservation well ahead.
08/19/2015,Philly,4.0,"I have never been to a restaurant that  didn't include  a potato and vegetable with a steak .....a la carte is one thing but that was ridiculous 


It was good for a special event ...but I don't anticipate going back there anytime soon"
08/19/2015,Steve,5.0,A great steak but like all steak houses on the expensive side.
08/15/2015,Bethy,5.0,"We eat here every time we come to the casino.  Steaks are exceptional and the fish, especially  the scallops,  are  a must."
08/15/2015,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Overall our experience was very good and we would come back again on a special occasion. Concern arises when dining at higher priced restaurants in regards to portion size, but the portions were large enough so as not to leave hungry as with some restaurants.  Still, the prices tend to make it a special occasion type of restaurant not a regular one."
08/13/2015,Rich,2.0,steak for two way to salty and steak was tough.  crab cake was fabulous. Caesar salad  was excellent. took way to long to get first drink.  halibut was just ok again way to salty. can't imagine it being Day Boat caught. but what ever.
08/13/2015,Vicky,5.0,"Not being a beef lover, I am always skeptical about my meal until I dive into the luscious flavors of the filet mignon.  It was cooked to perfection. Don't forget to order the awesome garlic bread with special dipping sauce... it is a must try treat!"
08/11/2015,JayB,5.0,We love going here prior to a night of gaming at the Sun. The steaks are amazing - with our favorite being the ribeye. The staff is very accommodating and allowed us to order half an order of our favorite bread. Super attentive and everything was cooked perfectly.
08/08/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Michael Jordan's is fantastic. I have only been there a few times because it is too expensive for me to eat at often. I usually only eat there on special occasions. Just took my mother there for her birthday and it was her first time there and she loved it as well.  If you have not been you need to try it!
08/08/2015,Great,5.0,"My wife and I splurged and went and enjoyed it to the max! Great food, great people and they made us feel very welcome. And you pay for it, and it is still worth it!"
08/08/2015,ash4,3.0,"The food was pretty good, but not GREAT. The servers did not ask if my steak was cooked appropriately (which is usually done at other restaurants). I also forgot to order a topping for my steak, but I noticed that other servers were asking if a topping was desired... mine did not ask, otherwise I would have remembered to order it.

I did love the half wine bottle option though - unique and perfect for 2!!"
08/06/2015,Amanda,5.0,"We have been celebrating special occasions here for over ten years. No other area restaurant can compare. The food is always excellent, the service is wonderful and the management makes sure to notice each special occasion with a complimentary card, champagne, dessert, etc. It is always a wonderful and memorable experience."
08/05/2015,Puglove,5.0,"Michael Jordan's steakhouse in Mohegan Sun Casino is great!! The service was wonderful and the food was delicious!!!  If you have room for dessert, the Baked Alaska is fantastic!!!"
08/03/2015,DRPAR,4.0,The overall experience was very good. Everyone was very friendly and informative. The food was very well prepared and tasted delicious. I would recommend to everyone who enjoys a great meal.
08/01/2015,Dinner,5.0,"I would like to comment on our recent visit to Michael Jordon Steakhouse. We arrived at our reservation time and were given our table right away. We were greeted by Julie our server with a smile and the dinner specials. She was truly delightful, attentive, and  a pleasure to have serve us. We offen come in to both the cafe and the steakhouse   She is the BEST server we have ever had. If you could pass on our comments to the Manager at the Steakhouse, that would be great. 
Thank Julie and the team for a great night. 
Roger and Glenda."
07/30/2015,Foodie,3.0,"Our gentlemen server took care of us on the bar area high top and he was outstanding.  Bread with blue cheese, steak and mac / cheese were good. Asparagus was tough and stringy (not peeled) and the halibut was frozen and over cooked. Wood tables and chair decorated dining room looked like an upscale truck stop, which is why we ate in the bar. No table clothes, fine glassware and China in an expensive steakhouse owned by a superstar ???"
07/30/2015,BostonEileen,5.0,"This past March 2015, we had dinner at MJ's Steakhouse and were very disappointed for the first time in several previous visits.  The wine we ordered was ""out of stock"", the steak was cooked medium well, although ordered medium rare and they forgot to include the sauce that was requested.  But, because this has become one of our favorite restaurants on the ew at coast, we decided to try it again for our anniversary.  We are glad we did!  Everything was terrific, from the wine, to the steaks, to the sauces, to the sides (we did mac and cheese and sautéed spibach).  Our server, Brian, was respectful, but outgoing and friendly.  We will gladly return!"
07/28/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Ask for Jimmy, if he is there the night you go to this restaurant, you are in for a great evening!"
07/27/2015,BAP45,5.0,The steaks were Incomparable and the waiter's recommendations were right on the mark.
07/25/2015,AndyFCPA,5.0,Everyone enjoyed the top quality steaks. But the side dishes and bread made the meal. The garlic bread with the cheese dipping sauce and the lobster mashed potatoes were the big hit. I also loved the corn off the cob!
07/25/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great food and ambiance.
07/25/2015,Benpuli5,5.0,Great place. Great food. Waiter named Mike was really professional and did his job very well. Very attentive.
07/25/2015,Lasttimer,3.0,"The server was great, the salad was very good.  The sides very average at best as was the bone in ribeye steak.  For a tab of over $200, I could have got the same satisfaction from Texas Roadhouse for under $80."
07/24/2015,SMARTYP,5.0,"We've been here a number of times and it's always been a great experience.  Steaks are tender, well seasoned and delicious.  My wife's a big fan of the lamb chops.  It can be a little pricey so it's best for special occasions, a nice evening out or following a good run at the tables/slots!"
07/23/2015,Volleyball24,5.0,Top restaurant with great food (the porterhouse for two is one of the best steaks that I have ever had) and a professional and knowledgeable staff.
07/23/2015,CindyIannini,5.0,"My husband and I went there to celebrate his 65th birthday!  It's a great place for a celebration because you are catered to and  treated like it's a special day even when it's not.  We both had the filet mignon, the lobster mashed potatoes, and the wonderful roasted mushrooms in madeira wine.  The steak was cooked to perfection, the lobster mashed was out of this world delicious, the mushroom were flavored  just right.  It can be a little pricey, however, the food and service makes it worth it."
07/22/2015,Chris,4.0,"This was our first visit to Mohegan Sun and our dinner at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse was a highlight of the trip.  After being served our drinks, our waiter suggested the garlic bread with blue cheese fondue.  What a delicious start!  Something very different and the 4 of us woofed it down! Salads came next and 2 of us got the wedge (with more blue cheese) and 2 of us got the Caesar salad.  Both were good, but quite large.  Now for the steaks:  I had the NY Strip which was perfectly cooked and very tender. Delicious.  Two others ordered the bone-in Rib Eye, but were disappointed with the amount of fat, although it tasted great. The other person in our group had filet mignon which was like butter.  We ordered mashed potatoes which were so tasty, but the creamed spinach was horrible.  Nobody could eat it. It was terribly dry and tasteless.  But, as far as I'm concerned, the dessert made up for any problems with the dinner! I ordered the Baked Alaska which was something very different and absolutely delicious!  It consisted of vanilla icecream with meringue on top and surrounded by carmel and pecans.  Although the others in my group had tasty desserts, all eyes (and palates) were on my Baked Alaska.  A great ending to a delicious dinner.  Definitely would return to this restaurant and I will make sure I save lots of room after my steak for another Baked Alaska!"
07/18/2015,Msat,5.0,"Great service at the front end and well as wait service.   Food was awesome from Wine, Sea Food Apps to steak.  Perfectly cooked and just the best way to enjoy Steak."
07/17/2015,dannyboy,5.0,"We had an enjoyable dining experience here.  a crowded Friday evening...albeit a little noisy....but a fun place with excellent food and drinks. cocktails were potent...they split a caesar salad for us...my steak was out of this world good, tender and of course..pricey Our server couldn't have been nicer or more knowledgeable. I guess you get what you pay for! Win some cash at the tables..and come here for dinner."
07/17/2015,Hchurch902,4.0,My steak was melt in your mouth good. Drinks excellent. Side dishes where just ok nothing special. Great service from all staff!!
07/15/2015,DDCD,5.0,My husband and I decided to treat ourselves to a night out since both of our children were away at respective Scout camps. We could not have asked for a better meal. It was absolutely delicious.
07/14/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Food and service were excellent. Enjoyed our entire dining experience!
07/13/2015,MaryAnn,5.0,I've been to many steakhouses but nothing compares to Michael Jordan's.  We dined at the Mohegan Sun location a few times already and it never disappoints us.  Not only is the steak delicious but all the side dishes too.  Wish there was one closer to our house!
07/10/2015,Woody,3.0,"The service is really good.  Other than that,  nothing else is very good.  It's incredibly loud.   The music is horrible, unless you like 40's jazz music.  The food-- incredibly expensive, and not all that good
Even the chairs are really uncomfortable 
Save your money and go to Bobby Flays"
07/05/2015,MJSteak,5.0,"The food was great, I was not disappointed at all.  Service was excellent.  I would definitely go back."
07/05/2015,RayDow,4.0,Second time at MJs and as good if not better than first time. Fillet Mignon ON the bone was really excellent. Good cut of meat and blackened to perfection (black & blu ). Don't mind paying the prices when food and service are this good.
07/03/2015,Lexigirl2,5.0,Nancy our waitress was amazing! She made the experience that much better :)
07/03/2015,TCChampagne,5.0,"We made our reservation through OpenTable and we had absolutely no wait when we arrived (whereas we have come across sometimes with a reservation at a steak house, we still end up waiting some time before we are seated...) The lighting and overall ambiance of the restaurant are great whether it's for a special occasion, or just getting together with friends or family. The booths would be ideal because it feels more private. However, we were sat at a small table and the seats were not very comfortable (I am 9 months pregnant so it was not the best seating arrangement). Although I did not drink, I did scan through the wine list and the wine options were great! Everything we ate there was up to par. I would recommend the garlic bread with blue cheese fondue and the beet salad. (Best beet salad I have eaten!) The mashed potatoes were the best I have had out in a very long time; and my husband said his steak was comparable to the Capital Grille."
07/03/2015,DandG22,5.0,"Our first time to MJ's and we'll definitely go back!  Food was even better than I thought it would be.  We each had a steak (husband had the strip and I had the petite filet) and we shared the lobster mashed potatoes - so awesome.   

The garlic bread with the blue cheese sauce is worth trying.  We didn't really know that we were being charged for a 1/2 order - we were asked if we wanted plain rolls or garlic - so we asked for a mix - and then were brought a 1/2 order of the garlic bread w/sauce, plus a small basket of really good plain rolls.  Would have been happier if we knew there was a charge for the 1/2 order of garlic bread, but it was a pleasant mishap, as it was very delicious!  Loved it all - was a great birthday dinner. Thanks!!"
07/03/2015,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Our steaks were overcooked - not something you would expect at a higher priced steakhouse - we would have returned them, but nobody ever came to the table to check on us"
07/03/2015,DanielJ,4.0,"Overall the experience was decent.  I had the bone in fillet special.  It was over cooked and lacked flavor.  My wife had the same it still lacked flavor but was cooked perfectly. My daughter and granddaughter both had the strip steak which I tried.  It was seasoned perfectly and cooked perfectly and tasted great. The mashed potatoes side was bland,the hand cut fries and asparagus were delicious.  For dessert the 23 layer chocolate cake was incredible.  The noise level was a little high but not horrible.  The biggest problem with the ambience was the smell of cigarette smoke that was coming into the restaurant.  I would definitely dine there again I would just not order the fillet."
07/02/2015,Mari,1.0,"I came in with 4 people as I had reservation for 7 pm. We set at a nice table ,after 10 minutes our waiter took our order and got us the wine that we ordered. We ordered foe dinner 3 ribeye  steaks and 1 filet mignon steak along with 4 sides .the waiter never asked us how anything was and didn't bother to ask if we want any bread or coffee on the end .we had to call the other guy whom it looked like a cleaning boy and he was very responsive in getting us the coffee thank god !
The best is yet to come; I  asked for the check and that was $ 379.00 total before tips. I paid the 379.00 with card and left $ 40.00 cash in the black folder for the service, as soon the waiter looked at the amount in the middle of the diner room he ran after me yelling about the tip amount, he said that is not even 15% and was totally unacceptable!! 
I never felt so embarrassed and intimidate in my life with such unprofessional and abusive experience from aa waiter person , after all he only came to our table ones to bring the food and the second time for the check . I think anyone who's in a right mind should never give that individual a chance to abuse customers  at such a great restaurant like Michael Jordan  .
My recommendation for you is to recruit  qualified individuals whom can be appreciated 
For any tip that customers will give to them even if the service was not up to standards at all !!!!

If you need the name of that waiter I will provide to you and he shoul be terminated!!!!!"
07/02/2015,Bobxxxxxx,4.0,"First, keep in mind that, many years ago I dealt with the casino restaurants in Reno.  After midnight, they had fabulous buffets for a buck.  If you went for a serious dinner, $20 would handle it for two people.  Obviously that era is gone.  

Last Thursday, we ate at MJ's.  To sum up, we had excellent service.  The food was excellent, except I thought my Delmonico steak was a bit on the fatty side.  However, we spent far more than I have ever spent on a dinner for two in my lifetime.  Let me put this into perspective:  As I recall, the most I have ever spent on a dinner for two was about $150, or less.  Our dinner, drinks, tips at MJ added up to more than $250.

You have great food.  You have great service.  You are way overpriced.

06/27/2015,Amylynn60731,4.0,This was my second time there. Food was amazing! I love the atmosphere there! My only complaint is it was crazy loud there for the 1st half of our dining but it did eventually quiet down.
06/27/2015,Melanie,5.0,"Really tasty food. On the expensive side, but worth it for a really great steak! Apps and sides were really good too. Gets crowded fast on a weekend, so go early (5pm had almost no wait) or expect a long wait."

06/19/2015,garsha,5.0,"This was our first dinner at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse and it was above our expectations.  Our waiter took the time to explain the menu and inform us of the special.  He  also allowed us plenty of time to absorb the menu.   Once our orders were placed they were presented perfectly and the timing was good in-between servings.  Both of our dinners were excellent and the NYS Strip was cooked to perfection and the best we have tasted in a long time.  We celebrated a birthday and at the end of our dinner our waiter discreetly brought out a delicious chocolate  layered cake with a candle.  What a perfect ending to a wonderful dinner experience.  Thank you!

06/13/2015,jbm1823,4.0,We really enjoyed our  dining experience. Knowledgable and helpul wait staff contributed to a great evening. It was a pleasure on all fronts.
06/12/2015,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Our service and the food were great. However the tables are VERY close together. A little too cozy. 

The noise level was enough to make me try somewhere else next time. It was so loud I could not hear the waiters description of some of the specials. We were two people at a fairly small table and had trouble hearing each other."
06/12/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We went to Michael Jordan's for the first time and it was worth the wait!  Service was great and all of the food was amazing!  Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a nice steak dinner.

05/31/2015,Josh,5.0,"we ordered multiple entrees and sides and every single bite of every dish was so delicious and exploding with flavor. 

This place still makes the best filet mignon I've ever had. It's pretty pricey, but I highly recommend if you're willing to spend for a special occasion.

**tip: if you're okay with sacrificing the ambiance and want the same great food for cheaper, go to Michael Jordan's sports cafe next door!"
05/30/2015,DDDP,5.0,"They were very accommodating with our seating, and the service was attentive.  The food is consistently excellent!"
05/30/2015,Becca1130,5.0,Made a reservation for 5:30pm and arrived to the casino earlier than anticipated. Went to see if they had an openings earlier than our reservations and they were able to accommodate us right away. The menu is always fantastic. One of my favorite places.
05/29/2015,timetodine,5.0,"Dined with friends.  We all ordered different entrees.  Everything was spectacular- the salmon, tuna, scallops and the special filet of the evening.  The garlic bread topped with the melted cheese is always a hit.  Noteable sides were asparagus, cooked to perfection, and sauteed mushrooms which were fabulous."
05/26/2015,Maureen,5.0,"Everything was great,  as usual.  Love the blue cheese garlic bread. Server Robert was great also.... Pricey, but worth it."

05/23/2015,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"I made my May 23, 2015 dinner reservation several months in advance.  Our dinner reservation was for 6:30pm  We showed up early (30 minutes) and asked if our table was available.  The host said no because the current guests were still seated at our table.  The host said that the table was in the back of the restaurant near the ""private dinning"" section.  I said great, thank you.  We returned 5 minutes before our reservation and asked if our table was ready.  The host said no.  At this point I understood that we were early and only asking if we could be seated early.  The table was not available, Ok, no problem. 

The front of the restaurant, closest to the entrance and bar was very crowed and loud.  At 6:30pm we asked the host if our table was ready.  She said no.  We stepped  aside and waited to be seated.  About 10 minutes later a host, not the host I had been speaking with, brought us to a table near the front of the restaurant.  I explained that we had expected, and been told, that our table was much closer to the back of the restaurant and that this table was unacceptable.  We did not sit down, but rather returned to the front section to be seated.  A manager came up to us and I explained the situation.  He explained that the restaurant was very busy and that ""our table"" in the back was not available.  I explained the request that I had made earlier and the comments from the host when we first arrived and subsequent conversation with the host.  We had to wait another 15 minutes.  The manager finally sat us at a table in the back at 7:05pm.

I feel the host was not honest with us from the moment we entered the restaurant concerning our table.  I would have preferred the truth about the availability and location of the table rather than being mislead.  In addition, our reservation was for 6:30pm not 7:05pm.

Oh p.s. It was our 28th Wedding Anniversary and wanted a special evening."
05/22/2015,Livingthelife,4.0,"Attentive wait staff, easy to make reservations, good quality steaks. Only issue was that the lobster mac and cheese was very dry. Seemed like it was last night's  left overs. For a signature dish- very disappointing."
05/22/2015,JohnT,5.0,Michael Jordan's makes every dinner you have there perfect but even more so when it's a special occasion!  Couldn't ask for better food and service!
05/21/2015,OpenTable Diner,4.0,received an email from open table stating that i missed my 6:45 reservation last thurs....We did not....we arrived early and asked if we could go in earlier.....We went for dinner at 5:20pm...other than that we had a very enjoyable evening and all was fantastic......
05/21/2015,Sheryl,5.0,Every time I dine here the meal is outstanding. Both excellent wait service and ambiance make the evening that more pleasurable .

05/21/2015,RIGHTANGLE1,5.0,"The perfect place where everything and everyone makes you feel amazing. The service is impeccable

It was really that good ! Michael Jordan's Steakhouse is one class act."

05/16/2015,eddrotman,2.0,"We eat at MJ very frequently.  Usually the steaks we order, bone-in rib eyes, are outstanding.
This saturday nite, accompanied by 2 friends, we were disappointed.  One of the steaks were very gritty and full of I guess musular string.  We should have sent it back but we really didnt want to wait for another steak and the other parties steaks were very tasty."

05/10/2015,FreddaT,5.0,"Thank you Michael Jordans for delivering exceptional food with an energetic and responsive team of professional servers in an atmosphere of friendliness.  It was easily the best dining experience I've ever had and was well deserved on this special day where my children and I celebrated the youngest joining his siblings in graduating from college in combination with Mother's Day.  Your staff provided the backdrop for our kicking back and enjoying with the finest steaks, appetizers, wine, coffee, and desserts.  We were thrilled and will be back for future celebrations.  It's expensive and well worth the price."
05/09/2015,Katie,4.0,Have been to Michael Jordan's several times. Was a little disappointed this time. They put us at a table all the way in the back of restaurant. Felt like I was bad and they put me in the corner. Also a little disappointed they asked  if they could bring bread basket it used to be a selection of several different breads this time they gave us 2 rolls that were stale asked for more bread and gave us 2 more rolls. Food was good potatoes were  mostly sautéed onions
05/02/2015,Elise56,4.0,Went with two friends to celebrate a birthday.  Waitress brought out a free dessert with candle.  Food was very good.  Only downside was we had an early reservation (5:30 on a Sat night) and we felt like they were rushing us to put our food order in.  But we did end up staying for 2 hours including appetizers and dessert.  Would definitely recommend it.
05/02/2015,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Maple Bacon appetizer was the best thing we had ever eaten!  Looked like a plate of ribs!
Bone-in filet was like butter...you could cut it with a fork!
Staff was friendly and attentive.
Nice atmosphere for our anniversary dinner."

04/26/2015,LisaK,4.0,We had a great post-concert dinner at MJ Steakhouse at Mohegan Sun. The waitstaff was excellent and gave great suggestions for odering. The food was absolutely delicious and came out hot and clearly just prepared. The bacon appetizer was amazing as was the Lobster Mac and Cheese. We would definitely go back again!
04/26/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We dine are Michael Jordan's Steak House at Mohegan Sun at least once a year and it never disappoints.  The food is excellent and the staff are knowledgeable and friendly.  It is pricey but standard for this type of service and food quality.
04/25/2015,Xteen,4.0,"I've been here a few times when we are at Mohegan Sun and the noise level just keeps getting higher and higher. They have a separate bar but now there's sitting at a bar in dining area and it's just way too noisy. I could hardly hear my husband or the waitress.
Trying to upscale means no one should be dining at that bar area in stools- detracts from the whole ambiance.
Our salad wedge was nice and they split it before serving which was also appreciated.
My steak frites was delicious and perfectly cooked but had to go back because it had cooled off too much. My husbands lamb chops were perfect.  The asparagus were excellently done but the lobster mashed potatoes lacked taste and were a bit grainy.
They need some new desserts cause there's nothing very exciting here.
Good steak but bring earbuds."
04/25/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Absolutely fantastic food. Probably the best steak I have ever had. The sides are pretty big and good to share. It is definitely worth the money.
04/25/2015,Pat202,5.0,"We had dinner here prior to a concert and thoroughly enjoyed it. Our meals ( steak and fish) were delicious as were the sides. The 23 layer cake was impressive to look at but not very good in our opinion. Our table was toward the back and in a corner which allowed for conversation and privacy but we noticed other tables were in walkways and not private at all. The service was prompt, friendly and attentive. It was very expensive but no different than other high end steakhouses in prime locations."
04/24/2015,Mike,2.0,"I was not pleased that specials were not told to us with pricing, and also explained sizes. We left half our food because the portions were very large and that should have been pointed out."

04/24/2015,Debbie,4.0,We always eat here before attending concerts at Mohegan Sun. This time the bread was stale and they changed all of their crusts and the one I had was not very good. We were a bit disappointed as it is usually very good.
04/22/2015,Sheryl,5.0,"Good food, attentivel service, nice atmosphere all add up to a wonderful dining experience."
04/18/2015,Gene,4.0,"Steaks are very good quality and cooked exactly to order (right up there with classic chop houses like Keens, Peter Lugar's and St. Elmo's.) Salads and sides were good, but not exceptional. Had a wedge salad which was a little light on the dressing, but with a piece of fat back bacon which was a nice touch rather than the usual 'bacon bits.' Too full for desert tonight, but we've had the creme brulee before which is excellent. The noise level is pretty high - if possible, get seated away from the bar and the inevitably loud birthday parties. Bottom line - we'll go back."
04/18/2015,DocVox,5.0,"We have been regulars (several times a year) for as long as they have been open and have never been disappointed in the top quality of anything on the menu. Only once did we have difficulty with specific requests regarding our reservation, but chalked it up to the person on the phone having a ""bad day."" However, our latest reservation was handled to my 100% satisfaction and it was another ""night to remember"" for us. A drink at the bar during our short wait for our specific table and it was back to normal for a quality dining experience."

Our porterhouse was med Ium not med-rare  as requested but didn't send it back because at least it wasn't dry. Came with 3 sauces which were excellent. The creamed spinach was good, not excellent. The dessert  menu IMHO could have had more variety-do they really need 2 chocolate cake choices? I don't like chocolate so passed on dessert. Would try it 1 more time."

03/02/2015,SnowyRow,4.0,"My husband and I dined at MJ's on my birthday this week. It was a Monday evening. 

Over all, we had a great meal and experience. 

The food was delicious. The steaks were cooked and seasoned perfectly (with a delicious salty and charred crust on the outside - yum!). The only complaint I have about the food is that I found a bit of shell in the king crab add-on with my steak. Luckily, I detected it before I bit down on it, but still, that can be a little off-putting. As I said, though, outside of that one thing, the rest of the meal was fantastic! 

Our server was very nice as well, and the service in general was timely (we received each course in perfect timing once we had finished the last). 

It is an expensive meal, but for a special occasion, I'd definitely go back."

02/27/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"I love Michael Jordan's steak house. As steak houses go it's one of, if not, the best I have eaten in.
The salad was crisp/fresh. The bone-in filet was outstanding! It was cooked to perfection and the flavor was awesome! The baked potato was large and tasty as usual and the mushrooms were fabulous!
Of course, this restaurant is pricey (casino environment,etc). While fully accepting the prices of the steaks and chops, I was shocked at the price of the salmon. I have ordered it many times here and felt the $34 or $36 (can't exactly recall) price tag was exorbitant and ""insulting"" for salmon.

But, overall MJ's is still one my favorite restaurants and I will go back again (probably won't order the salmon, though)."

02/19/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Amazing time. Great staff.
02/18/2015,MacS,4.0,Going to Michael Jordan's is a good bet for steaks. Wife had a crab cake which was huge and full of back fin lumps. Cocktails were GE euro us and well made.  Place was noisy but it seems like all restaurants in the Mohegan Sun are noisy.  Check out the Vista across the mall for a cool bar with the night sky projected on the ceiling.  Reservations are a good move especially if the Sun is full.
02/16/2015,Disappointed,1.0,"It was the day after Valentines Day.....Storm kept us in...we save a lot to go here for a special occasion.  EVERYONE told us about the Garlic Bread...as soon as we sat down we ordered and were told that they were out but they did have a GREAT crab cake.....yes, but for $20!!!  and I can not eat seafood.  So we were disappointed but went on to order dinner.....New York Strips.  He came back to tell us that they were out of New York strips but OF COURSE, not out of the higher priced cuts!!  He was very nonchalant about it and unfeeling. I guess they are not understanding about people who save up for a once in a lifetime experience.  We were so excited and had a night out without the kids and were sooo disappointed.  Waiter could care less....we did not complain, dinner cost $169.00 and we felt cheated and sad and so disappointed."
02/13/2015,KateC,5.0,"We are regulars here at MJ's. We try to make it up at least monthly, if not more often. Yes, it's on the pricier side, but you definitely get what you pay for. The food is incredible and the wine list is really extensive for a casino restaurant. My husband and I really enjoy our time here each time we go. If you're out as a couple, I highly recommend requesting a booth as they are super comfy and nestled away privately from the rest of the dining area but with a view of everything going on. We've never had a bad server and our food is always hot, fresh and quickly served regardless of how busy the restaurant may be. Definitely our favorite!"
02/12/2015,Showtime1,5.0,"My friend and I had an amazing meal.  It was our first time dining at this steakhouse in Mohegan Sun.  Our children ate in the Michael Jordan's in NYC.  The waiter was knowledgeable and helped us make a great selection.  We had garlic bread with blue cheese fondue, heavenly!  Then the special recommended to us was the lobster mac and cheese, perhaps the best dish I ever ate.  It was chock full of lobster and the cheese sauce was mouth watering.  For anyone visiting Michael Jordan for the first time, you MUST try the lobster mac and cheese!  We also had a fabulous skirt steak, cooked to our specifications, and again PERFECT!!!  I've eaten in many NYC steak houses and this steak was one of the best yet. I will definitely return to Michael Jordan's Steakhouse next time I go to Mohegan Sun.  By the way, the prices were mid range and on the lower side for such fine dining."
02/08/2015,CrissyK,5.0,A little on the pricey side but well worth it. The food and service was amazing and melted in your mouth.
02/08/2015,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"I felt rushed, the waiter spoke too fast, the resturant was very loud.

My steak was cooked perfect!!!"
02/07/2015,JeanneM,5.0,Fantastic steak great service our waiter Brian was delightful really enjoyable evening.
02/01/2015,Dreslady,3.0,"First I'd like to start by saying that I've eaten here a handful of times before and all of my previous experiences were 4-5stars..this time not so much. It was my birthday dinner with my boyfriend. The tram from our hotel was running about 7 mins late. Our reservation was at 7:15 and the confirmation email clearly states they will only hold the table for 15 mins after the reservation. I sent my boyfriend to go get our table as we had to walk all the way across the casino and I was in heels. He arrived at the host stand at 7:24 at which time the hostess tells him she can't find our reservation. I show up at 7:32 and show her my email confirmation at which time she tells me it's past the 15 min time window. I tell her that's why my boyfriend got here at 7:24 for our table but you lied to him and said you couldn't find our reservation because clearly you gave away the table before you should have not thinking I would show up with an email confirmation. Her response was ""I wasn't the one who gave your table away."" Does it really matter who did?!?! After that more words were exchanged. The hostess was very rude and the manager finally came to ""rectify"" the situation. The manager was pleasant and helpful, but at the end of the day we still did not get our reserved table and had to sit in a tiny hightop first come first serve table..not the most comfortable in a dress and heels.  The best part of our experience was our server (Tim?) he was very attentive and funny..he definitely helped to lighten my mood. He went over specials and menu thoroughly. The manager comped our first two drinks and they brought me a complimentary birthday dessert. As for my meal it was mediocre. I ordered the petit filet med rare..it came cooked medium..not very tender and would've liked it cooked how I asked given the price. The sides were good though and my boyfriend said his special bone in filet was delicious. We ate at Bobby Flayes last visit and our experience there was top notch..go there!"
01/30/2015,Vicster,3.0,"We ate here for the first time on Friday night. My husband loved his steak. My filet was dry. I do like it cooked to little pick but don't think it had any. We were surprised by bread charge. After placing our order, the waitress asked if we wanted regular or garlic bread. My husband said garlic bread! Well we got it and charged $9.50 for it!!!!!"
01/25/2015,Nicktwin,5.0,Everything was great! From the appetizers through the dessert. Wait staff was more than helpful and professional.white truffle filet was a slam dunk!
01/24/2015,Stevo,2.0,They need to review operational procedures. I left a note for the management team.
01/23/2015,Napkin,3.0,"My husband and I went here for his 40th Birthday.  Called ahead for reservations and they were ready for us as soon as we got there.  Ordered a great bottle of wine and started with the Oysters, phenomenal.  Scallops were my choice for dinner they were good but the sides eh.  Lobster mash potatoes were dry and Brussels sprouts were over cooked and burnt. My husband ordered the Ribeye which was cooked to his liking. I asked for a try and left puzzled the flavor had a unique taste. After a minute or two I realized it was Cheetos. I brought it to his attention and he agreed and followed with the statement good thing I like Cheetos!  I would have sent back. 
For what we paid for dinner I was slightly unimpressed.  We went to Tuscany the following night and with every bite we took we had a comment on how amazing it was. 
Tuscany ended up being half of what we spent at MJs."
01/21/2015,Clocker,5.0,"We thoroughly enjoyed our recent dining experience at Michael Jordan's Steak House!
We shared the porterhouse for two that was prepared perfectly and was delicious.
The service was friendly and attentive, and we will definitely return to MJ's very soon."
01/18/2015,Clynne1,5.0,"Extremely pricey, but you get what you pay for. Food, wine and service were all amazing. Steaks cooked to perfection and wait staff was very attentive."
01/18/2015,ImpressedJan17th,4.0,"I would characterize MJ's Steakhouse at Mohegan Sun as my number one pick for dining excellence. My reservation was honored in a timely manner by courteous staff members. Our server was attentive to our every need offering menu suggestions and insuring confidence that the chef would provide a allergen free meal for a member of our group that has a wheat allergy. Servings were prepared to perfection and the presentation was impeccable. All members of our group agreed that this was by far, the best dining experience we have ever had. I would strongly recommend MJ's Steakhouse when visiting Mohegan Sun Casino."
01/17/2015,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Awesome!!!
01/11/2015,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The delmonico steak was perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked.  One of the best steaks I ever had =)"
01/09/2015,Dinnerout,4.0,"Went there for dinner prior to a show with two friends. The food and service were great. The prices were high. Very high. Maybe that's standard for casinos? But for dinner pre theater that was not NYC, it was expensive. I would recommend the restaurant but would asterisk that price part."
01/07/2015,WayneC,5.0,We had dinner with my brother and his wife here 4 yrs ago for our wedding night and then we came back for our 4 yr anniversary.  Without asking they somehow got us the same romantic booth plus complimentary champagne and desert with candle.  A consistent service and food experience and great for groups as well!
01/04/2015,FlyingRICPA,2.0,"I've been going to MJ's for my birthday for the last few years - the Garlic Bread infused with Blue Cheese is amazing - as are the Lobster Mashed potatoes and the creamed spinach.  This year was different - garlic bread was burnt, took too long to come out and our meals came a few minutes later - no time to savor our appetizer.  While the server made it right - took it off of our bill and brought us a new order - I won't be back.  It's my understanding that they have changed management and in my opinion - not for the better."
01/04/2015,CharlesG,5.0,The filet Mignon cut like butter and the seasonings were wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed every single bite.
01/03/2015,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Rib eye was very grizzly for the price, couldn't eat the whole thing but everything else was pretty good.  My second time there, I would give it another shot if the occasion presented itself"

12/31/2014,Chief,4.0,"A great place for those special occasions. The only negatives are: background noise very high , hard to hold conversation (this is not the Sports Bar)   also the food is overpriced."
12/31/2014,paula,5.0,"As  usual, the food and service were excellent.  We had a wonderful experience!"
12/31/2014,Nibor,5.0,My husband and I were there for our wedding anniversary on New Year's Eve.  As always Michael Jordan's didn't disappoint when it came to my steak. It was cooked perfectly for me.  My husband had the salmon and was disappointed as it was much too salty.  He also had the mushroom side dish and indicated they were a bit rubbery.  The shrimp cocktail was wonderful and almost the size of lobster tails and of course the garlic bread was awesome.
12/31/2014,Delicious,2.0,"We stayed at the Mohegan Sun and were excited to have our first evenings dinner @ Michael Jordan's Steakhouse.  The steak my son ordered was ""sinewy"" and almost inedible. An almost $50.00 steak should be perfect  My filet mignon was overcooked even though I asked our waitress for the steak to be pink on the inside.  We were quite disappointed and would not eat nor recommend this steakhouse.  We had dinners @ Bobbie Flay/Tuscany and they were fantastic.  Not a quality of restaurant for a price tag of $263.54 for dinner for two.

Michael Jordan should be concerned that his name is associated with this restaurant at this location."
12/30/2014,Ting,5.0,"We have been dinning here multiple times, it never disappoints us since the first time we visited. The crab cake is the best of all peer crab cake. the Delmonico steak is the best!"
12/28/2014,Foodie,4.0,"Good steaks but a bit pricey. Otherwise, not a very memorable experience. I know I will go back at some point, but for now I am happy exploring other options in Mohegan Sun."
12/28/2014,Joes,5.0,Food was fabulous! And portions just right. Service was exceptional!
12/28/2014,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"I go here at least twice a month, I highly you try the blu cheese garlic bread as an app!"
12/28/2014,BBBB,5.0,"The steaks we had were excellent.  The lobster mac-and-cheese was amazing.  Service was great, very pleasant and attentive but not in-your-face. 

Prices were high, but we expected that.  

Only downside to our experience was the creme brulee we had for dessert was too heavy.  That is a dessert that should be light and flavorful.  This one was too custardy."
12/28/2014,JudyC,4.0,The food was great but the portion size for the porterhouse steak for two people was a bit small.
12/27/2014,SagamoreSammie14,4.0,"Very busy, bustling steak house with a NYC atmosphere at Mohegan Sun. Great service and superb food. Nice night out for 2 or a group. Would definitely come again."
12/21/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"I took my young daughter to MJ Steakhouse to celebrate my anniversary, as my husband is deployed, the staff was so kind. The service and food was nothing short of extraordinary. Much thanks for making my girls fine dining experience wonderful and my anniversary memorable."
12/20/2014,Little,5.0,"We visit Michael Jordan's once or twice a year and always enjoy everything .
The food and wine are amazing plus the staff are among the best if not the best That I have had the pleasure to encounter"
12/14/2014,SherylC,5.0,Cowboy steak is our all time favorite.  Wait staff are always on top of everything!
12/13/2014,GandMe,5.0,"We ordered the garlic bread, shrimp cocktail, Filet, roasted mushrooms and Gold Mashed.
Everything we delicious though garlic bread with blue cheese was very heavy. My steak was perfectly cook and my wife's was little rarer that requested but passable."
12/07/2014,askier,4.0,"Although the overall experience was very good, we didn't think the expense made it worth it.  Everything was an extra cost.  We did have 2 appetizers for 4 people and things like 1 salad, asparagus, mushrooms and potatoes-- but you have to have something in addition to steak.  We eat out often and don't mind paying for good food but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone only because of the cost."
12/06/2014,Todd,5.0,"Dined here before seeing Bob Seger at Mohegan. Despite the fact the dining room was very busy, Adriane, our server and her assistants were extremely efficient, friendly and made our dining experience excellent.  Good wine choices, pefectly cooked steak, a 1 lb. baked potato and a great bottle of Two Hand's Angel's Share Shiraz capped off a perfect night at MJ's!"
12/06/2014,KurtN,5.0,"Great food,  nice atmosphere 
 Very enjoyable.  Will go again"
12/04/2014,WorldTravler,4.0,"The meat( bacon and porterhouse) are amazing!! Everything else is meh. The physical restaurant needs an overhaul it' tired. 
Ordered a$85.00 bottle of wine waitress had no comment when we asked about it obviously no sommelier on duty. We poured it ourselves, no assistance. The shrimp cocktail shrimp were limp and warm. The steak was amazing and the sauces fantastic. We finished our bottle of water and were never offered more. 
The 23 layer cake was out of this world, but the dinner plates sat piled on the table we had to ask for their removal. I know they push people in and out but at these prices one expects MUCH more."
12/04/2014,Gene,3.0,Food and service continue to outperform and prices continue to rise. Cost now at a level of questionable value for money.
12/03/2014,Matt,1.0,"Note.  This was my first time visiting MJ's in Mohegan Sun.  I reviewed prior OpenTable reviews (some reviewers offering praise, with others disclosing some of the issues I encountered during my visit).

I reserved a table for 2 at 6:30 pm.  The restaurant was empty, except several large parties from a convention held at the Casino.  The hostess seated us next to the bar (next to the rowdy convention goers) and food service station... despite the fact that I already had reservations and I am an OpenTable VIP.  The restaurant was also completely empty.  We asked the waiter to move our seats, to which he replied that he was unable to because other tables were already accounted for (I am guessing the waiter wanted to retain the gratuity on the table).  There were plenty of open tables throughout the night and the place was not crowded at all.  So, very poor service.

On to the food.  My steak was burnt on the outside (as other reviewers have noted) and lacked basic seasoning.  The gristle was not cut away properly either.  My dining partner ordered the filet minon (not the petite, but the full size filet), but I am pretty sure he was served the petite as the portion size was incredibly tiny.  The kitchen and chef are not Steakhouse quality chefs by any means.  This is all the more infuriating given their price point.

I would not recommend MJ's to anyone."
12/02/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The service was outstanding -- and the food was delicious.  The garlic bread with blue cheese fondue -- not a crumb left on the plate -- so tasty and addictive!  The Delmonico Steak -- and the Filet Mignon were both cooked to perfection.  AND then we had dessert -- we had the Baked Alaska and it truly exceeded our expectations.
11/28/2014,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"We expected more from this venue. The Thanksgiving turkey special was a ""ordinary"" and we expected outstanding. The breast meat was dry and the gravy was ""blah"". The portions were generous and the service was outstanding but the restaurant was noisy and the atmosphere lacked the ""warmth"" to allow us to relax and enjoy our visit."
11/28/2014,valentine,4.0,"Everything at Mohegan is pricey, so that really isn't a surprise. The food was great, the wine list was great, the service was great."
11/27/2014,Retired,3.0,"Food was decent,way too expensive.Old tired desserts.Reluctant to give us booth we specified.You are paying for the name not the meal.No ""wow"" factor.Wait staff excellent."

11/22/2014,OpenTable Diner,2.0,I am a regular at mohegan sun restaurants.   My wife and I have now been to all the fiNE dining establishments a few times each.   6 months ago we tried Jordans steakhouse and had a veal chop that was undercooked.  I had it Sent back for reheating and it took way too long to get it back.  I spoke with the manager after and too my shock he was not apologetic only made excuses and I walked away as if I did something wrong.   Fast forward to Friday night.  My wife and I tried it again...appetizer and wine came out to us in a reasonable amount of time....but it was 45 minutes to 60 minutes after that and finally our porterhouse for two arrived.    The waiter was nice and nervously checked in with us a few times promising it would be right up.   Once again I summoned the manager and once again I was apparently wrong for questoning the time to get our food.  I was told it was unusual to take that long and that this restaurant gets rave reviews for service.    Im ok that once and awhile issues happen...but I am totally amazed at how I walked away twice feeling like my feedback was to be honest unimportant.    This is a service industry and at 200 bucks a meal i expect a whole lot better Mr Jordan.
11/22/2014,MJBerry,5.0,"We eat at MJ's many times when at Mohegan Sun.  It is by FAR our favorite restaurant on-site.  Last Friday, it was especially good.  Our waiter, Jimmy was fabulous!!!  He was extremely knowledgeable about all the dishes and especially the wine.  We had a nice conversation about Pinot Noir and he recommended one for our next visit.  I had filet mignon which never disappoints.  DH had the steak special.  We also shared chili corn which is also a favorite of ours.  We have never had a bad meal here and would highly recommend!"
11/21/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"This was probably one of the best steaks that I've ever had.  The side dishes themselves were even quite impressive, but I would go back in a heartbeat for the steak.  I had the bone-in ribeye and I don't think I've ever had a more juicy and flavorful steak in my life.  It is pricey, but entirely worth it.  I highly recommend it."
11/20/2014,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"Dinner was brought while we were still eating salad.  Busperson took plate out from under me.

Very embarrassed as I was at a convention and my clients joined me for dinner."

11/15/2014,Wastednight,2.0,"Old lady hostess was mean. Brussel sprouts burnt, and they refused to take off bill."
11/15/2014,Papajoe,5.0,"Our first experience at this restaurant, but a most memorable experience,,,have dined at many well-known steakhouses throughout the country..this one ranks near the top.  First class cuisine, wonderfully-paced meal and, above all, a most attentive and personable waiter.  Many thanks to Jimmy for making our 35th wedding anniversary dinner a delight."
11/15/2014,DJR1,2.0,"Over the last 7 years, I've been to MJ's many times, with friends, family and employees. I've always recommended this to people, but I will not anymore. It used to be a very special experience to dine there. The last time we went, we sent back several drinks and some of the food just wasn't what it used to be. I chalked it up to a bad night. However, on Friday, I took my wife there for her birthday and again, it didn't come close to what it used to be. It was expensive before but now the prices have gone up further, with less attention to detail, less quality & declining service. I always have the tuna tartar appetizer when I dine at MJ's. It's usually delicious. This was bland & the creamy ""sauce"" that's in the mix was watery. We ordered the garlic bread, which we love to ""start with"", as I told the waitress. It was good but the tuna tartar arrived at the same time, something I asked the waitress to bring after the bread. Before we had a chance to finish our appetizers, our steaks arrived. I mentioned, ""wow, that was a little too quick"" but no response from the food runner. The steak had a texture unlike ever before and although it was decent, was not succulent like usual. It was a filet, so I wasn't expecting the juices that you get with a fattier cut, but nonetheless, it was dry, even for a  filet. We chose to have dessert & drinks elsewhere. The only reason I didn't mention anything else to the waitress was because she and the other servers were gone so quickly from our table and I truly did not want to ruin my wife's experience. We were done in under an hour!!! Normally, we sit for at least 2 hours ordering more drinks and dessert.  Maybe they're learning something from Subway. Get 'em in, get 'em out.  Very disappointing. This has always been our ""go to"" place for special occasions. In fact, we had a very large party to celebrate a 50th birthday last year. With prices like these and spending 1000's over the years, you expect special. I doubt  I'll ever return."
11/12/2014,bobbyboe,4.0,Went to Michael Jordan Steak House for the 3rd time while visiting Mohegan Sun CT. We always make a reservation there for dinner. The staff is on top of its game and keeps the drinks and food coming with very little wait time. The food was excellent as always with us always getting the lobster mash potatoes. TO DIE FOR!! The garlic bread AMAZING!! But with all things there was one down side. Ordered the stuff lobster and they didnt have any available. This was the first time this had happened. But over all I would recommend this place to friends and family.
11/09/2014,LisaS,4.0,"Food was awesome, drinks were great, waiter was great.  When we showed up for our reservation our table was ready. The only negative is this restaurant is very loud."
11/08/2014,Csoave1,5.0,"By FAR, THE BEST STEAK I have had in a long time. The drinks were strong, the appetizers tasty, the sides delicious (those fries!!) and the most tender, flavorful juicy Filet & Rib Eye out there. Thank you for a wonderful dining experience and reminding me what a superb steakhouse should be."
11/08/2014,Bethy,4.0,Have been to MJ's many times.  This was the first time the steak wasn't up to par.  Everything else was great.  Would still return.
11/08/2014,LOVINGIT,5.0,MICHAEL JORDAN' STEAK HOUSE IS OUR FAVORITE RESTAURANT AND I RECOMMEND HIGHLY TO EVERYONE WE KNOW.
11/02/2014,kayvee,5.0,Best restaurant at Mohegan Sun. Great service excellent steaks. The grilled corn with chili lime butter is my favorite side. Highly recommend
11/02/2014,NYAnnie,5.0,"For starters it was Caesar salad, then filet, asparagus & hand cut seasoned fries w/scallion ranch dipping sauce! Excellent!"
11/02/2014,Kush,5.0,"a wonderful place, wonderful food, a great night away from kids."
11/02/2014,HeaZ,1.0,"Upon arriving, the hostess was BEYOND RUDE. She had the worst attitude and communication skills with the customer. She was quickly removed from the hostess desk once we spoke the the manager about her poor attitude. The food was okay..very overpriced. The stuffed lobster only had lobster in the tail...the steak was so tough you couldn't even eat it. I would never recommend this horrific place to anyone..especially when the bill was $190 even after giving us a free appetizer for the terrible service."
11/01/2014,FoodieMerr,5.0,"Not cheap, but it was worth every penny! From the moment we arrived, the service was exemplary. There was a card acknowledging my guest's birthday (something I'd noted in my online reservation). The thin crust and airy texture of the ciabatta garlic bread made for a fantastic vessel to dip into the blue cheese-laced alfredo sauce. Next, we shared a salad of beets & goat cheese with hazelnuts. The portion was very small but quite delicious. He had filet mignon. I had NY strip. I have never had a more perfectly cooked steak. The crust sealed in an abundance of juicy flavor. The lobster mashed potatoes were a little much, but still very good. The creamed spinach was perfect. The complimentary chocolate birthday cake was a terrific ending."
11/01/2014,donnadubes,4.0,Usually order Filet Mignon but had to try the stuffed lobster.  Good choice - it was excellent!
11/01/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Service was EXCELLANT!  Even laving the restaurant I never had so many people that did not wait on me thank us for coming!
He food was fantastic.  We where glad to see you had Baked Potatoe as an option once again. I could never understand why you removed it from your menu!   The same goes for the Kansas City Cut of steak!  My wife & Iordered the KC & we where not dissapointed as it was outstanding."
11/01/2014,Enjoydiningout,4.0,"Kurt, our waiter was good but treated us like we had never been there even tho we told him we had been... And the Halibut was tasty, but was not hot... Kurt didn't return to see how we were doing for a long time ... Too long to ask for ithw fish to be reheated as everyone was close to being finished...for $300 for a party of 4 (with only 3 draft beer total) it was disappointing..."
10/29/2014,rosie,5.0,"As always the food is great. Best steaks, I love their take on the salad wedge. The crab ""cake"" is just a large portion of the best Jumbo lump crab. It's enough for a dinner just add a side. Jennifer our waitress was very good."
10/25/2014,OpenTable Diner,2.0,I was recently at your restaurant for the first time and was very excited. When the food arrived I was very disappointed steak did not seem as big as they said it was 92 oz steak didn't even fill me and my gf and we usually get 10 oz steaks at other places. The lobster Mac and cheese was the worst we have ever tried we each took one bite and left it alone. Even though we did not eat it the waitress didn't offer to take it off the bill or bring us something different but rather not say anything about the full plate of food that she brought to the back and threw away. Overall a very disappointing experience and so not plan on returning because of it
10/25/2014,jjax1119,4.0,"We dined here with friends before a concert.  The service was excellent - each person we encountered was polite, efficient, and seemed to enjoy their jobs.  The steaks were very well seasoned and cooked to perfection."
10/25/2014,kjckat,5.0,"Steaks were cooked perfectly.  Service was excellent. Noisy, but it's in a casino so that's to be expected.  Pricey but worth it for a special occasion. Atmosphere was very casual."
10/25/2014,Ccgmcl,5.0,Wonderful meal! Great service! Filet was outstanding and the fries were the best we have ever had! Can't wait to go back!
10/25/2014,Daisy,2.0,"My fiance and I were in Connecticut for the weekend and decided to spend the night at Mohegan Sun and had dinner here. The ambiance was nice and spacious however they sat us on a small two-top between a  column and a big party. We asked to be moved and the hostess kindly moved us to a spacious booth. The waitress was nice and recommended their ""famous"" garlic bread and blue cheese dip, although I expressed we don't love blue cheese she insisted claiming it's their most popular item on the menu. The appetizer arrived and it tasted like frozen garlic bread and the blue cheese dip was nothing special. We had steaks, my fiance's was good but mine was very bland and a bit dry. The rest of the food was good but sadly nothing extraordinary. If we ever have to be in the area again I think I would give them a second shot since the rest of the reviews are good....but their standards are questionable."
10/24/2014,KrissyF,4.0,"I've been to Michael Jordan's twice. I had better service the last time we went. Although the food was delicious and literally brought to us hot off the grill, the steak I ordered to be well done was. It cooked well done. When I mentioned it to the server he brought it back to be cooked more. No one came over to apologize for this nor was it taken off the bill. Now, when it was brought back it still wasn't 100% to my liking but I did still eat it and overall I enjoyed the meal. I just feel that in a pricey place like this the customer service could use a little improvement"
10/24/2014,JennyLynn,5.0,"Delicious food, great service! It is one of our favorites!  You obviously have choices of steak houses in the area with other restaurants in the Mohegan Sun but this place is wayyyyyy better than the other one it is next to by that famous chef!  The ambiance is better, they treat their customers better, and Michael Jordan's is just a more fun and vibrant restaurant.  If you are looking for more privacy, ask for the tables that are the ""booths"" where you are sitting more in the wall than out in the dining room."
10/24/2014,Sross,5.0,"My wife and I have been coming here for years now.  Always a great dinner.  Love the Garlic Bread with blue cheese fondue, and the steak is always cooked perfectly"

10/19/2014,Wonderful,5.0,First time the and will look forward to coming back. Quality of food was amazing. Loved the garlic bread fondue especially
10/19/2014,Dave,5.0,Exceptional food and great dinning experience.  Outstanding service!
10/18/2014,foodies,1.0,My hubby and love a great meal and don't mind beefy prices provide we love the food. The steaks came out the wrong temp all around- too much dressing on the salads (they were drowning). We were very disappointed:(
10/18/2014,Michael7,4.0,Overall we had a very positive experience at Michael Jordans. We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and requested a quiet booth when making our reservation through Open Table but unfortunately were seated at a table for two with other tables right next to us. When we mentioned it to our server she made an honest attempt to get us moved to a booth but there were none available. The appetizer (shellfish tower) and our meals (ribeye and NY sirlion) were excellent and the service was outstanding.
10/18/2014,Ken1,5.0,I like the special message awaiting us on our table.  Wish us a Happy Anniversary. Dinner was great and so was the service.
10/18/2014,KateC,5.0,"My husband and I frequent MJ's whenever we have the chance. We are always met with fantastic service, excellent food and romantic atmosphere."
10/18/2014,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Great aged porter house for two cooked perfect med-rare.  Salad and special bread is fantastic.  Skip the desert.
10/17/2014,Gordiehm,5.0,"My wife and I had the Filet Mignon, Creamed Spinach and Mashed Potatoes.  All I can say is WOW. The meal could not have been any better."
10/17/2014,Paolo,2.0,My husband and I have visited this restaurant for years. We spent a lot of anniversarys here. Brought friends with us and always left raving about it. Not this time. Food was mediocre. Service was average. Seemed very dark. Had trouble reading the menu. I would expect this from an average median priced restaurant. Prices are way too high for what they offer.
10/16/2014,JohnM,5.0,"It was my wife and mine 10th year anniversary. I let the restaurant know through Open Table. The service from the waiter Anthony was attentive and polite. the steaks were spectacular (mine A Filet, hers a bone-in Ribeye). The staff wished us a Happy anniversary and comped us a Baked Alaska as an anniversary present.
This is an expensive restaurant located at the Mohegan Sun. I consider them a special occasion destination based on the price, but they have the best steaks in CT. If I were a gambling man I wold use my winnings to dine here more often"
10/14/2014,OpenTable Diner,3.0,The bar is too small. They burnt both steaks the first time. They made me feel it was my fault. Who sears steaks especially fillet? They were very professional but I didn't appreciate not just saying sorry. Instead it was oh it's a different cook some people like it seared.. But I'm spite of that I would recommend the place just be careful in ordering food
10/13/2014,eat2live,5.0,"We try to eat at Michael Jordan's Steak house every time we visit Mohegan Sun. They have the best steaks and lamb chops around. Also, the side orders are big enough to split. The desserts are to die for!!! Very enjoyable experience!!"
10/13/2014,SPOILED,3.0,"I was disapointed because you were out of all bone-in steaks. The steaks we ordered were good, but when we always order the bone-in rib eye we were instantly disapointed and it was hard to enjoy the meal that was very acceptable."
10/11/2014,BeverlyJ,5.0,The service was awesome my fiancé had some issues with his stomach that nightabd the waiters recomended couple choicesof meal that would be easier on his stomach. He ended up ordering the salmon which he said was great and he was pleased with it...
10/11/2014,Joseph,5.0,Food and service here is spot on. Have dined here on numerous occasions and have never been disappointed.
10/11/2014,Mary0301,5.0,"This was an excellent choice as a treat for someone special. The food was outstanding and with great service. Ambience was subdued and classy. High prices, but worth it for a very special night out. We loved it."
10/10/2014,Bella1973,4.0,"Everything Was delicious! The only small problem, our server, who was very nice, spoke so fast and low that we had trouble understanding what she was telling us!"
10/10/2014,nhus0410,3.0,"My husband and I went there. The service was good,very noisy restaurant. I had the grass fed rib eye. So grisly and tough. I couldn't eat it. The server was lovely. The manager came over and offered us dessert. For $46. I want to eat my dinner. I thought the steak could have been taken off the bill."
10/09/2014,Capebill,4.0,"My wife and I had an excellent steak dinner, including appetizer, salad and potato, all of which were perfectly prepared. The service was top-notch."
10/05/2014,Hemmom,5.0,We were looking to have dinner at a good steakhouse and this restaurant did not disappoint us.   Food was absolutely great!   Everything cooked to perfection.  The garlic bread was delicious.  We had the porterhouse for two that was sliced for us and served with three dipping sauces. Will definately return.
10/05/2014,sam1023,5.0,"The food was amazing! The steak was cooked to perfection, and we highly recommend the Lobster Mac & Cheese! Ask for it!"
10/04/2014,Steam385,5.0,"Whenever we go to Mohegan Sun, my wife and I always have dinner at Michael  Jordan's Steak House.  We  are ones that, nearing the age of retirement, and not eating as much as we use to, are very conscious about portions.  Plus I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes this year so I several other hurdles.  Well we were pleased to see a 23 oz bone in rib eye on the menu; plenty for the 2 of us.  We ordered that through our waiter Jimmy and to our amazement he was all for it, very gracious, and totally understood.  Naturally the appetizer of Garlic Bread with the Bleu Cheese fondue was fantastic as always.  The entire staff is fantastic.  My wife had been there several times before we met 10 years ago; once a year since then has been a joy !!"
10/03/2014,Torr,2.0,The food was amazing. The service was beyond slow for the amount of tables in the restaurants. Servers cough into their hands and then wait on tables. Servers handle silverware without gloves. If you get the table next to the server station you can hear them complain about work all night. Servers texting out in the open. Do that in the BOH!!
09/28/2014,greengenes3,5.0,We had an excellent meal celebrating my father in law's 80th Birthday.  The filet we had was cooked perfectly. The salad and bread was excellent. We had a side dish of mushrooms that were tasty. The desserts were mouthwatering!! It's an expensive meal but worth it for a special occasion. I would come back and dine here again.
09/28/2014,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Very good service, top notch food, tables are close together and the room is very, very loud.  Price is high but you get what you pay for."
09/27/2014,5052,4.0,"My husband and I ordered the porterhouse for 2 cooked medium.  It arrived very undercooked, raw in center, however the manager had it sent back and a new one prepared.  This one came out perfect, cooked medium and full of flavor."
09/27/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"I had always wanted to eat at Michael Jordan's, but never had an occasion special enough.  My wife and I were celebrating our first anniversary, so I got my opportunity.  We could not have been happier.  The food was incredible, and might be the best meal I've ever had.  Definitely get the garlic bread, the lobster mashed potatoes, and the fingerling potatoes...... The ambiance and service were on par with the food, too.  Expensive, but absolutely worth the money for a special occasion.  This will not be my last visit."
09/27/2014,DebC,5.0,"Jordan's does not disappoint. This is a must do at Mohegan. The steak is the most tender, flavorful you will ever have. The staff is polite, well attentive to your needs."
09/22/2014,JDBSWB,4.0,"When visiting Connecticut, a trip to Michael Jordan's is something I look forward to.  It is expensive, but you know that before you go.  The food and service is outstanding.  It certainly helps to offset the cost with a good run in the casino."
09/20/2014,PinotS,5.0,"My husband and I continue to return to Jordan's for special occasions because of the excellent service and great food and wine.  When feeling casual, we dine in Jordan's sports cafe next door.  If the lobster Mac n cheese is ever offered as a special, you must order it!  The Go-Go bread, or garlic bread as some call it, is a great way to start your dining experience."
09/20/2014,Chad,4.0,"The overall service was good, thanks to the multiple staff that support our primary service.  The filet was overcooked."
09/20/2014,StacLy,5.0,Can’t say enough great things about this restaurant.  From food to service all was outstanding.
09/20/2014,LynnP,5.0,"This was by far one of the best steaks I've ever had.  I'm a big fan of Capital Grille NYC and Del Friscos...this was top notch!

Will definitely be back."
09/13/2014,Mrsheather,5.0,Love this steakhouse!   Food and service are both amazing!!
09/13/2014,3Wishes,3.0,Not comfortable dining when you have to shout across the table to be heard
09/13/2014,StkLvr,1.0,"We were not impressed with MJ's. It was just my husband and I, and our table for two was 1 foot away from the other tables on either side. We were basically having conversations over our table ""neighbors."" Our waitress was not the most friendly and did not seem as though she was interested in us what-so-ever. She never even came over to ask how our food was, or if we needed any other drinks. Our food came out and both our steak and lamb chops were extremely overcooked, charred on the outside, and raw in the middle. We sent the lamb back and waited 30 mins a replacement, but when it never came, we had to wave down our waitress to get our food. Both dishes lacked flavor. Neither dish was worth the $50 each we paid. We will not be returning."
09/13/2014,ValC,5.0,I loved this restaurant. We don't eat at high end restaurants but we will definitely be back..the good was phenomenal!
09/12/2014,luv2dineout,5.0,"I had an incredible evening go celebrating my 22nd wedding anniversary on Friday night.  The waitress was professional and knowledgeable. She recommended wines and appetizers that were to die for.  We had the smoked bacon,  the crab cake,  and garlic bread.  We also had the oysters!  The entrees,  steak and halibut,  were delicious as well as the mashed potatoes and asparagus,  cooked to perfection!!"
09/09/2014,goodfood4me,5.0,"The service was excellent and all the staff was very attentive, from filling water glasses to clearing empty dishes. The waitress was helpful in giving her suggestions on the menu items from the entree to dessert and did not steer us wrong. The filet was cooked perfectly and very tender. If you enjoy delicious steaks this is the place for you."
09/08/2014,DeeN5974,5.0,"My husband took me there for my birthday.  From the time we walked in, we were greeted by courteous friendly and smiling staff.  Brian, our server, was very knowledgeable about the wine list and the menu.  Brian the manager came to our table to be sure we were having a great experience ... and we DID!  Can't wait to go back."
09/07/2014,meem,5.0,"We had dinner at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse while visiting Mohegan Sun casino last weekend.  The food was absolutely amazing.  Everything was fresh and flavorful. The garlic bread appetizer was off the hook - we couldn't stop eating it.  The wine list was great, the steak was tender, juicy and bursting with flavor.  The lobster mashed potatoes were loaded with creamy flavor.  The crab cakes were delicious - bursting with fresh, sweet crab meat and very little breading.  The baked Alaska topped of a gastronomic explosion.  We were all beyond satisfied with enough leftover for a meal the next day!  Service was impeccable and the ambiance was warm, welcoming and soothing as compared to the craziness of the casino floor."
09/07/2014,toddbennett,5.0,"Michael Jordans steak house is our Mohegan Sun go to. Great service, very attentive and courteous. Food is always good however we are finding the prices and getting a little too high. Definitely worth trying when you have the opportunity."
09/06/2014,Jaclyndbz,5.0,Excellent Food and service. Celebrated birthday for girlfriend.
09/06/2014,marianc,5.0,"always a good meal service great. staff helpful  We enjoy the go-go bread aand steak was cooked to perfection.
The porterhouse was cut for us so easy to eat."
09/06/2014,nicojsar,5.0,The steak was great as well as everything g with it. We also enjoy the changing menu there.
09/05/2014,gourmand,4.0,"The food quantity, presentation, temperature and taste were exceptional. Hard to cook a medium rare steak as wanted. Michael Jordan's did it! Vegetables could have been a bit cooked more/less raw tasting."
09/04/2014,Ryan6666,3.0,"Ordered 4 steaks. 1 Demonico and 3 Filet Mignon's. One Filet Mignon came back very dry and well done. Supposed
to be medium. Waiter suggested nothing to us. I think he was worried we would be here longer. Disappointed with 
the way the waiter handled our problem. We don't complain, I guess we should have asked for a Manager.
Not sure if we would go back, expensive if things aren't perfect."
09/02/2014,uncleb,2.0,"The Good: The crab cake. Probably the best I've had. Even at $19.50, I felt it was worth it. Also, very good cocktails.
The Bad: Not great at nailing down the temperature of medium pork (way overdone) or rare steak (was done essentially the same as the carpaccio: seared on the outside, completely raw on the inside).
The Ugly: Steak not trimmed well. A substantial section was gristle. For $53, the only part not edible should have been the bone.

More good: Our server was friendly and took the overdone pork off the bill without us requesting it. 

If you're looking for a place for a drink and a crab cake, I highly recommend. If you're looking for an expensive-but-worth-it steak, go with Morton's or Flemming's."
09/01/2014,DCM422,5.0,"Been to Michael Jordan's, at Mohegan Sun many times. I enjoy the aged porterhouse for two. That is all I have ever ordered along with different sides. If you like beef, this is the place to go."
08/31/2014,regfan,3.0,First off i called to make a reservation about 9 hours before we were arriving. I reserved a booth. When i got there they sat us at a regular table. I told them I had reserved a booth and they said sorry they are all reserved. I thought I reserved one. This is not my first time here but this time it fell short. We were offered rolls when ordering drinks that NEVER arrived even after us asking twice. We ordered a full bottle of wine and the waitress opened a half bottle twice. normally when they bring your filet mignon and salad they wait for you to cut it open to be sure it's cooked Ok. That never happen. never offered pepper they usually do. We went with another couple they could not believe service could be so bad for a $400 dinner.
08/31/2014,MJSH,4.0,The food was great the menu and wine list slection was great. however the restaurant was quite noisy
08/29/2014,mnoormo1,3.0,"The steakhouse has premium prices but the quality is not the same.  The garlic bread appetizer was delicious.  The steaks were cooked to perfection albeit after the filet mignon had to be sent back because it was not medium rare.  The chimichurri sauce lacked flavor.  The decor is nice and not the atypical dark steakhouse.  The service was poor.  Our server did not come by to ask if our steaks were cooked properly.  One of our party had to flag down a manager.  The lobster mashed potatoes is a side I would recomend. It comes with big chunks of lobster meat.  
The wine selection is good. The Francis Coppola Preserve is an excellent red wine for steaks."
08/29/2014,ChristineD,5.0,DELISH......WONDERFUL...WE HAD TO HURRY TO GET TO A SHOW...VERY GOOD FOOD...STAFF  VERY ACCOMADATING ...WE  WILL BE BACK...THANK YOU....

08/29/2014,KaplanTCha1957,5.0,"You must try the 23 layer chocolate cake-awesome. The creme brûlée was excellent too. Was disappointed with the Skirt Steak, would not recommend-overall food was delicious and generous portions."
08/24/2014,BillF,5.0,"We were seated at a booth which I think was because we were Open Table reservation.  We had dined there previously but it is always a preferred destination given past experiences.  We had a great bottle of wine and started with the bacon appetizer coupled with the toast and cheese sauce and a beet salad which in combination was ridiculously great.  We had the porterhouse to share which was served with the bone and the filet separated which worked out perfectly.  Desert was not an option as we were sated.  Great place,  Easy and we will continue to go there every time in the area"
08/24/2014,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"It was our first experience at MJ Mohegan Sun.  The food was excellent, especially the NY strip cooked perfectly to medium rare.  The disappointments were when our party of 4 arrived, the hostess station could not find our reservation.  Also, and more disturbing was the main course was brought to our table and we were still finishing the appetizers.  I just wish the meal was spaced out more appropriately."
08/24/2014,Ky22,5.0,Amazing food. Great service. Pricy but worth it. Enjoyed my filet and Mac n cheese was to die for
08/23/2014,Mike,3.0,I had a medium Filet and it was cooked to the right color but it was dry. I mentioned it to the waiter but he didn't do a thing about it.
08/23/2014,Zinful,4.0,Our waiter was fantastic! Very attentive and knowledgable . The food was delicious. The spinach was especially good. The only problem was that it was very noisy. Hard to have a conversation.
08/23/2014,excellent,5.0,the service and food was excellent. I highly recommend it whatever the occasion will be
08/23/2014,Easternpnt,5.0,We go here for special occasions and have never been disappointed. The service is impeccable and the food is amazing. I highly reccomend.
08/20/2014,Michelle,5.0,"I have to say, I've been to almost all the restaurants at Mohegan and this is one of the best.  My Delmonico steak was cooked to perfection and the lobster mashed potatoes are to die for--but know you can split them!"
08/20/2014,Bullfrog,5.0,"Maybe I'm just lucky, this is my fifth time at MJ's. I look foward to eating there, the steak is great, apps and sides fantastic. Service is
attentive. Yes, by some standards it is expensive, I figure at least $100/pp with drinks plus or minus depending on your selections.
I don't mind spending a little more for a great meal. Try the bacon."
08/19/2014,Steakhouse,2.0,"Been here before this time not very good sides warm not hot steak ok but warm Ruth Chris much better , had to ask for bread basket received with entree , not happy with it this time not sure if we would go back"
08/16/2014,Steve8badresto,3.0,"Started out with some appitizers the shrip cocktail sauce tasted like ketchup & the shrimp were fishey.Ordered a filet mignon cooked perfect & very tasty,but was the smallest filet I have ever seen served in a resturant.For 43.00 for a filet it should not be smaller than a bussiness card.Ordered some sides very tasty no complaints there.Service was good waitrest took shrimp off of bill.I would have rather just had a good appitizer.The bread at the table was also a little hard not fresh.Not a good place to go if you are hungry.I will not go back."
08/16/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We went for dinner the good was amazing the service was fantastic could not of been happier. We then returned after our show for desert the drinks too notch the food amazing the service HORRIBLE!! Complete opposite of our first server she was unattentive and seemed bothered that she had to work!! Not enough to keep us away for the fact our first server could not have been more helpful professional or courteous
08/16/2014,Jordans,2.0,"We have been to Jordan's before and have had a great meal.
This time was not like the other times.
Our meals were not great.
The chicken dinner was dry and over cooked.
We boxed it up and then throw it away so it would not stink our room up.
My salmon dinner , you couldn't even taste the salmon because of all the olive tasted that was on it.  
They can do a lot better with their food."
08/15/2014,Denny,5.0,"Great steaks! The manhattans are were very good. They just need to use better cherries.

Very good service!"
08/12/2014,Kare1921,5.0,The prix fixe menu offered a little something for everyone. 3 courses for $45 is a great deal. The Garlic Bread with blue cheese fondue is a must have!!
08/10/2014,Waylaid,2.0,"I had a party of six, no bread was brought to the table nor a wine list. We asked the server for several glasses of house wine she suggested a bottle, we ordered two assuming they were house wines. The wine was $150.00 a bottle, I don't think they were house wines, we were a bit surprised. I have been here three times in the past and they have all been exceptional."
08/10/2014,Ooreogg,5.0,"Food was perfect, had the porterhouse for 2. Garlic bread for an app. Loved it. We have enjoyed every meal we have had here"

08/08/2014,foodlovers,5.0,"We first tried Michael Jordan's last summer at a visit to Mohegan Sun. We were so impressed with the food, the service everything. So when we planned our visit this year the first thing we did was make a reservation for Michael Jordan's steak house. We were not disappointed. The food and the service was every bit as good as last year. We had a very enjoyable evening. The next time we visit Mohegan Sun we will be eating at Michael Jordan's."
08/08/2014,dasrp,5.0,"I only dine here once or twice a year but I look forward to it each time. Food is excellent but not cheap.
 I asked to sit in one of the private booths. Much better conversation and romantic too."
08/08/2014,5yranny,5.0,"Perfection!  Service was superb, food was out of this world, and wine list was incredible.  Very pricy, however if you really appreciate fine dining, you look past price easily."

08/04/2014,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Very pricey but food is very good and good portions. The service was a little slow.
08/03/2014,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The steaks were fabulous. We had a 9 oz filet and a 14 oz New York strip. The beef is air dried and as tender as butter. The atmosphere is noisy and pedestrian (bare wood tables). Service was good as was vegtables (roasted asparagus) and dessert (warm chocolate cake). The wine by the glass, we had Goldschmidt Cabernet which was excellent, represent a good selection at fair prices. All in all we had a very good evening. Romantic it was not good it was."
08/03/2014,Luvmysteak,5.0,As always great time !! We absolutely love the steak and service was top notch!!!
08/01/2014,Tbone,5.0,"I have been to the Michael Jordan's restaurant several times for both personal and business occasions.   Whether with a group of girl friends for a special birthday, or the mixed company of business colleagues, or just a romantic two-some, Jordan's has yet to disappoint.  The waitstaff is always professional and attentive. My steak is always consistently cooked to perfection. And the wine list manageable; not too cluttered to find an affordable,  very good bottle. I love to treat myself occasionally with a special concert or a quick get-away, so having somewhere to go for dinner that is consistenly top-notch is comforting.  
TIP: if you're looking for the same great quality, but a little more casual menu and lower prices, check out Michael Jordan's 23.Sportcafe adjacent to the upscale MJ restaurant at Mohegan Sun."
08/01/2014,Valentines2024,4.0,"Food was good and the service was great. The salmon was very tasty. My husband even said it was tastier than his filet mignon. He is not a seafood kind of guy, either. However, the restaurant is quite loud, which keeps the romance n intimacy level to a minimum."
08/01/2014,George,5.0,"A little bit of everything, and a lot of great steak. Great wine list. Pricey, but you get what you pay for."
07/29/2014,gal53,5.0,"Great experience as always.
Love the atmosphere, the food and everything about the restaurant!"
07/27/2014,Girlygirl,3.0,"The server did not look happy to serve guests that had a TravelZoo voucher.  The prix fixe menu had three choices each for appetizer, dessert and entree.  They were out of one entree choice and one dessert option.  My husband was very disappointed.  We were seated in a high traffic area, where everyone knocked on the back of my seat as they rounded the corner. My steak was well done (I had asked for medium-well.)  The highlight of this outing was the great dessert.  The manager made good on this deal when he offered us our choice of dessert to substitute for the unavailable selection. This visit was not the same as our first two visits to this location."
07/27/2014,Dano,5.0,Great food and time every time we have visited. No complaints at all
07/27/2014,James,4.0,Michael Jordan's is a nice place to eat after a WNBA game.  They were very accommodating in seating us 30 minutes prior to our reservation.  The food was good and the service was attentive. My only complaint is that it is pricy.
07/27/2014,AWBoston,4.0,"Pros:
Food: quality and presentation of food meets the expectation of a fancy/pricey restaurant
Atmosphere: upscale and fancy
Service: both wait staff and bussers are attentive and friendly
Good for groups: restaurant is spacious, has large tables, waitress was willing to give each person in our group (5 people) a separate check

Cons:
Price: although the food and atmosphere live up to the cost, it is pricey restaurant
Some limits on the menu: non-alcoholic drinks are limited to a few sodas (no juices or lemonade), limited ability to customize dishes (they could not add chicken to a ceasar salad)
Noise: music is slightly on the loud side"
07/26/2014,PJ55,5.0,Not just a steakhouse.  Excellent steak but also outstanding fish dishes
07/25/2014,Elfe,4.0,I ordered my steak medium but it came well done. As I was very hungry and we had not a lot of time I didn't ask for a replacement. But I'm sure they would have made me a new one. Anyway also the well done steak was very good and the sides as well.
07/25/2014,AdamLambert,4.0,"We went to Michael Jordan's before the Queen with Adam Lambert concert.  We're both steak lovers so it was an easy decision to go with the Bone-in Ribeyes.  I was hungry before we got started so the waiter convinced us that the Garlic Bread was a good starter to share.  Unfortunately although we asked for the Blue Cheese Sauce on the side, and were told that the dish was not 'too cheesy' (because my wife is not a big blue cheese fan) we found that the garlic bread itself was very cheesy so having the sauce on the side really didn't help a lot.  Would have been good if the waiter had known that overall the dish was cheesy.  Overall we were a little disappointed with the appetizer choices for sharing.  

Steaks and sides were just right."
07/25/2014,thedarkestknight,5.0,"Service was great, the bacon ap was out of this world, one of the greatest ap's I've ever had.  A high quality steak, not the best I've ever had, but it ranked up there, well worth the price, cooked perfectly.  This is a nice place to dine while at Mohegan for anything.  Dress code was more casual than other high end steak restaurants I've been to, probably due to the nature of being located in the casino, which is a plus as we were attending a concert after dinner.  If you're at Mohegan looking for a fine dine and a freat steak, I recommend."
07/25/2014,Lovefood,5.0,"Arrived late due to traffic and called ahead and they were very accommodating. Have a 15 minute grace but waited 20 minutes for us. 
Food was amazing and I highly recommend their garlic bread as they are known for it.
I don't drink but wine list looked extensive"
07/24/2014,SheilaM,5.0,We were celebrating our wedding anniversary...we had an amazing meal!
07/23/2014,Rich,4.0,The bone-in rib eye steak is one of the best.  Flavorful and tender.  Highly recommend it!!
07/22/2014,Mcdivers,5.0,"We were pleasantly surprised when dining at MJ steakhouse, contrary to some reviews. Attentive staff, great recommendations for menu selections and great timing on course arrival. Jennifer, our server, was very pleasant and urged us to try the Garlic bread fondu to which we were thankful as it was fantastic. I had the bone in ribeye and my wife the filet, both cooked perfectly. We added the fries with a truffle aioli and a corn off the cob side. A half bottle of wine to accompany the meal was perfect. Highly recommend."
07/20/2014,Bullfrog,5.0,"Four people, we all enjoyed the food and service. Al a Carte upscale steakhouse, so be prepared to pay a few bucks for a meal. My way of thinking is that I'd rather pay a little more for a great meal then less for a medicore one."
07/19/2014,ctarrow,4.0,"This was our second time back to Jordan's in a few years. Service was good though but not perfect. We were forgotten about more then once and it appeared that the restaurant was understaffed. 
However, the main reason we went there was to have a really good steak. Sadly, Jordan's did not deliver. What I received for $46 was a 14 oz delmonico that was no better quality then I would have received from a lesser quality establishment. My wife has a Filet and while it was okay, it was not great. Both of us were disappointed and agreed that when your dropping $240 with tip for drinks, dessert, 2 pieces of steak and 1 side, it was not worth it."
07/19/2014,Mayhem,5.0,We had a great dinner here.  Try to get one of their private booths instead of a table - makes the experience even better!  A little pricey but the food is worth it.  Don't order too many sides because the portions are big enough to share.
07/19/2014,Thinglet,5.0,"This was my 3rd visit to Michael Jordan's Steakhouse and again, I was not disappointed!   This restaurant has to be the best I've ever dined at.   Yes, it's pricey but, well worth the money.   I just love it !!"
07/18/2014,OpenTable Diner,4.0,The steak was out of this world. I.m still talking about it . Awesome sums it up.
07/16/2014,Clocker,5.0,Our dinner at Michael Jordan's Steak House was excellent! My wife and I shared the porterhouse for two which was prepared perfectly and was delicious. Our dining companions both had small filet mignons that were also prepared perfectly. The four of us shared an order of cheesy garlic bread that was very tasty. The service was friendly and attentive. We would recommend this restaurant for a fine dining experience and we will definitely return to Michael Jordan's in the near future.
07/12/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"my expectations are always met, we will be back. Steak is perfectly cooked."
07/12/2014,StJohnGal,1.0,"Wear your headphones to drown out the noise. Tables close together didn't help.
Do not order salmon because all the chef knows how to cook is steak. 
Quite expensive too.

In short, we would not go back there."
07/12/2014,WontRushBack,3.0,"It's VERY loud which makes conversation difficult.  Our server was very pleasant, but once he took our order, we had to track him down to get any service until it came time to order dessert or coffee.  Normally once food is served, someone comes over to ask how it is, but no one did.  I needed to send my steak back to have it cooked some more but couldn't find our server right away.  Caesar salad had no zing.  The filet that two of our party ordered was amazingly good and tender.  It had much more flavor than our rib eye."
07/12/2014,bluehouse,4.0,"We went to Michael Jordan's Steakhouse for a birthday dinner. We chose the garlic bread with bleu cheese fondue - absolutely divine, porterhouse for 2 ordered medium with black truffle parmesan topping - perfect, caesar salad - delicious, grilled asparagus - excellent. Before our check was delivered we were surprised with a birthday dessert (no charge!!) and it goes without saying that this was delicious. We will definitely dine here again!!!"
07/12/2014,AngelaA,4.0,"We really enjoyed our visit and the delicious food. Best steak I ever ate... but it was so dark we couldn't read the menus. We had to take the votive candle out of the holder and shine it on our menus, taking turns."
07/07/2014,Maryb,5.0,Four of us. We were there to see Katy Perry for my daughters sweet 16. Delicious !!! Our waitress was very funny and helpful! We would have stayed longer but concert was starting! We have been here many times and ALWAYS come back!
07/07/2014,RistoranteUomo,4.0,"Last couple of times were disappointing, especially considering the prices.   But this time food was much improved from the prior time, and the service was much better then my last trip, it was also pre-concert at 530 pm or so so maybe that helped.

Wedge salad was terrible, not ""fresh tasting at all"".   Filet Mignons, NY strips, etc were all much better then my last two trips.   This is really the place to go at the casino since IMHO most other choices are very weak."
07/06/2014,mom2mia4,5.0,The wedge salad....to die for!! The garlic bread....to die for!! Corn off the cob...to die for!! Need I say more?
07/03/2014,LeeLee,4.0,"The steak was perfect and the wine list perfect for steak. The decor was beautiful, but our table was so close to our neighbor, that it added a level of stress in trying not to overhear their conversation. At the prices, I expect more space to meet the food, service and decor."
07/02/2014,Lungcharlee,3.0,Our mistake for not ordering steak. My scallops was tasteless and my friend's chicken was dry.
06/30/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Loved it.  Excellent food and service. Beautiful atmosphere.  Conveniently located.
06/29/2014,Tastydiner,3.0,"About $100 per person for a steak and shared potatoes and veggies with one drink per person.  Steak was very good, but nothing memorable for such a high tab."
06/29/2014,biscuit,5.0,"My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and wanted to go to a special place. The food the delicious and the staff was very nice.
The portions were perfect .  I would recommend this restaurant to everyone. Can't wait to go back again."
06/29/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,I've been wanting to try this restaurant for years.  It was sooooo worth just wait.  The food was so good from the salad dressing to the filet!
06/29/2014,EllenSF,5.0,"My husband and I had dinner and were seated in one of the booths running along the side of the restaurant.  The booths are private and romantic.  The food was absolutely incredible.  We have both eaten at some of the top steakhouses in New York, Boston and Las Vegas and the food at Michael Jordan's was just as good.   The menu is a little pricey but definitley worth it for a special occasion."
06/29/2014,Manley,4.0,"One of the best steaks I have had.  Sides were great, service was good, and the ambiance was great.   Would consider this over some of the other top name steak houses.

Ny strip was my favorite."
06/28/2014,Jerry,4.0,"This is a very good place to eat and this is the second time I've been to this location.  Service was excellent both times I've been there.  This time all the food was great, except the rib-eye special (cooked medium rare) was a bit tough for my preference.  I guess I'll stay away from it the next time I go there.  All-in-all a very pleasant dining experience and we will be back."
06/28/2014,Winelover,5.0,The steaks were out of this world! The service was excellent. A defenite must go to restaurant.
06/28/2014,Love2Eat,5.0,"It all started with the ALL-CRAB - no fillings/stuffings - delicious Crab Cake!!! Not to miss!!!

Then, the Truffle-Parmesan crusted steak (forgot the cut) ... AMAZING!!! My husband loved his Filet, the kids shared the skirt steak and were thrilled with it!!! All meats were cooked to perfection!!!

As silly (and maybe a bit sad) as this sounds, their French Fries were off the charts!!! We're all still dreaming about the Rosemary and aioli on the side. We also loved the corn that had a kick too strong for the kids but was delicious. My kids loooooooved the MacNChz saying it was the best they ever had!
The 23-layer choco cake and ice creams were delicious. Too much!
Pear Martini - off da'charts!!!
Our waiter, Brian, ROCKED!"
06/27/2014,Dineout45,2.0,"As always the atmosphere at mj's is wonderful.  Service was very good but the food was a disappointment.  The steak excellent but the salad was so small fit for a child.  The bill was outrageous coming in at 220.00 for 2 steaks, 2 salads, 2 glasses of wine and 2 beers.  It will be awhile before we return."
06/23/2014,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"On my most recent visit to MJ's Steakhouse, I've gotta say I was a bit disappointed. In the past on previous visits, I remember the food being a lot better. The steaks & side dishes were always so savory & delicious.  My skirt steak this past time was a bit sub par & my girlfriends filet mignon was just ""ok"".  It might have been b/c we visited late on a Sunday night about an hour before they closed. But as someone who also works in the restaurant industry, that's no reason for poor food quality. As always, service from our severs & hostess staff was awesome & right on point. Guess the kitchen just had an off night."
06/22/2014,rodview,4.0,"Went to show at Mohegan Sun Casino arena and MJs is a very convenient, soecial and pricey spot for dinner"

great job staff!!!"

06/22/2014,Legasea,5.0,Had 8:30 reservations in prep for a night out at the casino and my wife Diane and I had a fantastic meal.  Get the bacon appitizer it was awesome and the scallops were world class and perfectly cooked.  I had the bone in strip and it was cooked to perfection.  Attentive service and generally a very good place to enjoy a night out.
06/21/2014,dannyboy,4.0,Excellent experience here. restaurant was packed on a Saturday evening  but our service level and food quality were both very high. Cocktails were potent and tasty....steaks were done properly and were delicious. the mac and cheese and corn sides proved a great choice. waters get refilled often......all of this comes at a hefty price....but for that special affair....MJ's seems well worth it. recommended.
06/21/2014,donnadubes,4.0,I have eaten a Michael Jordon's many times.  The good has always been excellent no matter what you order.  The steaks are very pricey but you get what you pay for.  The seating is very timely with reservations and the service is excellent.
06/21/2014,Nicole,3.0,"Had high hopes for this one.  The garlic bread with the blue cheese fondeau was the highlight. Veggies over cooked, potatoes seemed old and stake was ok.  A bit pricey for what we got.  Service was great."
06/21/2014,HWD3,4.0,"We have eaten at MJs several times in the past. This time the steaks were much better. The aged KC steak, Porterhouse and Filet were tops for a steak house. Keep it up MJ."
06/21/2014,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"This was my wife's Bday dinner with another couple joining us. We were led all the way to the back of the restaurant to our table against the back wall. We ordered drinks wines for the ladies one beer and I had Grey Goose rocks with a slice of orange, the drink was watery and my orange had to left from lunch hour. for $9 should have had the whole orange at my disposal. Order Steaks ladies Filet Mig guys MJ Rib Eyes $50. Mine Med Rare/His Med rare. mine Black and blue cool Raw had to go back.his wrong crust .had to go back... ladies eating all fine Asparagus 6 pieces $12 rest of sides mediocre at best. Steaks are back his crust now correct my steak still almost to rare for my liking tried to make up with deserts. never go back 460 plus tip.."
06/21/2014,Champ,5.0,Superb food with outstanding service. Exceeded my expectations. The garlic bread surprised us. The crab cake was the best I've had outside of Baltimore. The steaks were cooked to perfection.
06/20/2014,Plumber,5.0,One of my wife and mines favorite restaurants.    Can not beat the food or the atmosphere.  We will definitely be back in the future.
06/17/2014,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Nice place .Pricey.Not very busy .Went on Monday night.Did 48 dollar special.Portions tasted great but we're small.Would go again.
06/15/2014,winendine,5.0,Garlic bread is great. Lobster mashed potatoes are delicious. Steaks are amazing. We will return.
06/15/2014,Maryjim,5.0,"As usual the service along with the wine, food and atmosphere was wonderful.  I have recommended your restaurant to everyone I know coming to Mohegan Sun.  Friends are catching the Michael Buble concert and I have told them to make their reservations now!  Always a great experience dining at Michael Jordans"
06/15/2014,RLT1,3.0,"We have dined at Michael Jordan's a number of times over the years and have founds the food exceptional.  However, our last visit on Father's Dad was really disappointing.  The quality of the food has declined, as has the creativity in its preparation.   I had my usual fare, dry-aged steak with roasted potatoes and a salad, at a cost of nearly $60.   My son also ordered a steak.  Both steaks were just okay.  Until this visit the steaks at MJ's were always first-rate.   They must have changed vendors for this product since our last visit.  At these prices I think I would be better off sticking with Ruth Chris's."
06/13/2014,CB06854,4.0,"Only issue was scallops were overcooked just enough to be a little tougher than they should be....other than that--great oysters, delicious roasted beet salad..."
06/13/2014,786FoodGuy,4.0,"When you pay $200 got a meal, you have certain expectations and they come very close. The food was great except for the ""colossal shrimp"" which were just normal shrimp extremely overcooked. The service also was great- attentive, knowledgable, friendly. The only complaint would be they rushed a little bringing courses on top of each other. For the price, I want to take my time. The garlic cheese bread is a must! The steaks were perfect and an excellent wine selection. Recommend splitting your steak for two and have only one side- you'll be more than satisfied!"
06/12/2014,JAL727,5.0,"Celebrated our parent's Wedding Anniversary (55 years!) 
Our servers Rachel and Jason were great."
06/04/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Whether a great night out, or a special occasion, this restaurant is a must!  The food was ALL fabulous, the service top-notch, and the restaurant clean and wonderfully decorated with a welcoming atmosphere.  The prices were moderate and the food was all well worth the price.  Everything was fresh and perfectly prepared."
06/01/2014,Jessieb4,3.0,"With reservations, the seating took a while which was unacceptable since there were several empty tables.  After getting seated next to the glassware station, we noticed very quickly how the many people (staff) that contined to pass by or table which was distracting and I began to get annoyed.  We moved to a different table, ordered food and the crab cakes, lobster mash, and crab legs saved the night!  Thank God for the chef because the food was amazing!

The wait staff is young, unorganized, and snappy.  You can tell there's staff drama.  It doesn't take 5 hostesses to run the front of the restaurant."
05/31/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Absolutely fantastic...best steak we've had in years!
05/27/2014,Jcharm,5.0,"Best in Connecticut for food,service,value. Can't wait to go back! We used the travelzoo special and the staff didn't miss a beat. Very impressed"
05/27/2014,hombreadams,5.0,"Michael Jordan's is a special night out.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  I never felt rushed.  Since it was our anniversary they brought us each a glass of champagne.  The food is spectacular.  Full of flavor with new twists on standard themes.  It's pricey, but you get what you pay for."
05/27/2014,mjgreatpick,5.0,"The steak was excellent and cooked to perfection, and the servers were very courteous and prompt.  We would definitely come again.  My wife chose the price fixed menu which had choices she wanted and I ordered something different to suit my taste. Both choices were awesome and it also made it more affordable.  We went for our anniversary and this made if very special."
05/25/2014,acm212,3.0,"Went to MJ Steakhouse to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. Service was slow, server took forever to come to the table during our dinner. However, she waa very nice. Extremely loud,  I felt like we were screaming across the small (cramped) table."
05/25/2014,ME64,5.0,"We had one of the best meals I have ever had.  The steak was unbelievable, and the service was top notch.  I would highly recommend MJ's Steakhouse"
05/25/2014,BeefStew,5.0,"The Tuna Tartare made you mad when it was gone, the aged ribeye was tender and cooked to perfection (medium), the grilled corn off the cob and roasted asparagus a perfect compliment and the Pinot Noir washed it all down very nicely.
A little pricey as expected but if you're going to treat yourself to a night out Michaels Jordans is a great place to do it."
05/25/2014,chuck,5.0,"Always enjoy eating at Michael Jordan's Steak House at the Mohegan Sun.  Food is quite good and the service is excellent.  Sometimes, it takes a long time to get your main course.  The kitchen always seems to get slammed when there is an event at the Casino.  Best if you are NOT rushed to get out."
05/24/2014,Kudos23,5.0,My wife and I had the pleasure of dining at MJs.  The steaks were brilliant!  I ordered the Bone In Ribeye and my wife had the Filet.  We ordered our steaks Med Rare with the Truffle Parmesan Crust and mushrooms on the side.  We were blown away.
05/23/2014,dgthom,3.0,"Wasn't the best steakhouse I have been too, but was good.  They push the garlic bread appetizer, and for good reason - that was excellent.  My wife and I got the steaks which were also very good (Delmonico and filet mignon).  My main complaint is probably the atmosphere, it was dead in there.   Probably because it is a casino, I would guess their NYC and Chicago locations are better."
05/23/2014,Fishpaw,5.0,"Had the local cut which, a fabulous rib-eye from a NY State farm. Generous portions. Both the blue cheese sauce and the pepper crust (they call it au poivre but it's not the classic French au poivre ) were tasty, but there is a sizable up charge for each. They slightly overcooked my medium rare, but it was still quite tender. The fries came out too salty, but were replaced in minutes w a perfect batch. My husband and I shared a Caesar salad and the kitchen split it expertly. No fuss whatsoever. 
The service here was beyond excellent--- knowledgable, accommodating, efficient. This is actually our primary reason for coming here. We can go a few places for a great steak, but the employees of MJ's restaurant make dining an exalted experience."
05/22/2014,disappointed,3.0,I had the filet mignon and my brother had the N.Y. strip. I requested it to be cooked medium plus and even though it is a carnal sin I had to send my steak back to be cooked a bit more because it wasn't even quite medium. When it came out it was charred on the edges. Filet was $41 and the strip was $47. Food was anywhere from okay to good but for the price it should have been excellent. I won't go back.
05/22/2014,Dunnie,5.0,"We went here for my birthday and was extremely happy that we did.  Everything was top notch.  The hostess, the waitress, the clean up of our table (which I think is an important aspect), to the great appetizer, fantastic meal and the scrumptious desert!  The only things I would comment on is that the prices are a little pricey and we are wine drinkers but opted out because the prices were very steep.  Other than that it was great."
05/19/2014,Hometown,4.0,"We celebrated our 40th Wedding Anniversary and enjoyed a lovely evening.  From the ambience to the food to the superb waitstaff, we enjoyed ourselves.  Both Jimmy & Bailey were friendly, attentive and professional.  Thank you for a memorable evening!"
05/18/2014,Nate,4.0,The food is awesome though the noise level is through the roof.   Reminds me of a sports bar that serves fantastic steak and food.  If you don't mind a lot of noise and people laughing at the top of their voice when they are drunk this is the place for you.  Oh and their sides are large enough for two although they seldom tell you this before ordering.  I have been 7 times now over the years and only once did a server mention the size of the portions.
05/18/2014,cageylefty,4.0,"Made a reservation for Michael Jordan's at Mohegan pre-Springsteen concert and like the concert, were richly rewarded. Great steaks, nice sides, little pricey, but par for the course with casinos. Service was efficient and cognizant of concert time. A good choice!"
05/18/2014,Michael,4.0,loved the steaks!  good stop prior to the concert....................
05/18/2014,PeteAbe,5.0,"Michael Jordan's was great from beginning to end. Table right away (with a reservation), drinks, salads, great steaks, terrific sides (try the lobster mac and cheese) and an excellent desert. The service was top-notch, too. The menu is not extensive but you can find everything you want in a great steakhouse."
05/17/2014,grammy,1.0,"First seating was at a very poor spot and people were on top of us.  So noisy we couldn't hear each other talk.  We asked to get moved and did to a better spot.  Service was very slow. We ordered salad, porterhouse for 2 and some sides.  The steak took forever and tasted awful.  It had such a bad aftertaste it almost tasted like it was boiled.  When we reported this poor selection, we were told that we should have mentioned it and would we like something else.  We waited 30 minutes for this steak and didn't plan on spending the whole night there.  And then we were asked if we ever had dry aged beef. We have been to the finest steakhouses in this country and travel a lot so this was not our first time at a steakhouse.  Never again!"
05/17/2014,Jpdinner,2.0,"The minute we walked into the restaurant I said to my wife, ""there's no way this is going to be good, it's way to big."" The menu is enticing with lots of great choices. I ordered the local cut medium rare. It came out raw and when I asked for it to be cooked more, it came back charred. I told them it was perfect and ate it (my fault completely , I should have sent it back again but didn't want to spend the night in Michael Jordan's and my wife was done with her meal by this point). Long story short, cut your prices in half and the restaurant would be fine. It's not a top notch steak house. I do not recommend Michael Jordan's. Sorry 23."
05/17/2014,Johnny99,5.0,"A bit pricey, but that's to be expected in a casino setting and you pay for the Michael Jordan name.  Still, fantastic steaks and filet with great side dishes.  Friendly, accommodating staff.  Excellent table service.  A bit loud, but it was during the running of the Preakness and the night of the Springsteen concert, so the whole casino was amped up.  Great experience - will dine there again."
05/16/2014,Nicole,4.0,This is a stylish restaurant with a great menu and greatfood!  You can't go wrong with the garlic bread appetizer or the Parmesan truffle topping on any of their delicious steaks!
05/15/2014,Wiseone045,4.0,The food at the restaurant is terrific. This was a special occasion for my wife and I.  When I made my reservation I was asked to put any special requests. I put in the notes that it was my anniversary but it seemed it didn't matter. Nothing was done with it.
05/12/2014,BecP,5.0,Really good food and service.  A nice meal in a great location
05/10/2014,Yummysteak4life,4.0,"Overall, great dinner and service.  The food was excellent; however, it was very noisy in the restaurant."
05/10/2014,suemconn,3.0,"The service was fantastic. Our waiter was attentive and nice. The food just wasn't as good as we hoped and certainly not worth what we paid. I got the scallops over risotto. The risotto wasn't cooked and without it the scallops alone had no flavor. 

My husband got the bone-in ribeye. He liked it but said it wasn't any better than other ribeye he's had. 

We had a reservation and were seated on time. The restaurant was busy and extremely loud. 

Overall I wasn't impressed. I don't mind spening $250 for dinner but I want to be impressed."
05/10/2014,Chip,5.0,"Wonderful food and service. Just don't worry about the about the total, tax and tip and you'll be fine.

They get what people are looking for in a fine dining experience"
05/10/2014,Pops,4.0,A great steak. We were in a hurry to get to a concert. Out wait person timed the arrival of the various courses perfectly. We were impresssd. We would definitely return.

05/09/2014,Ireneri,5.0,"The food here is always absolutely delicious, meat cooked exactly to your liking. Sides are great - loved the asparagus and the roasted corn, yum!
Make your reservations early when a popular show is at the arena. We arrived at 6pm and had just the right amount of time to enjoy our meal and our conversations before getting to an 8pm show."
05/09/2014,mikea,3.0,"What I requested and what we received were so different.

I requested a quiet out of the way table. They wanted to seat us at the first table as you walked in, we took the table next to that one but soon found out dinning next to the waiter stations was a mistake.

You either didn't deliver what we requested or Michael Jordon's failed."

05/09/2014,Perfect,5.0,"EXCELLENT meal, excellent service. VERY accommodating. Enjoy our dinner every time I go..."
05/06/2014,Benito23,5.0,I loved my time at Michael Jordan Steakhouse. The waitress was great. The food was delicious and very well cooked. Overall I was very impressed with everything.
05/03/2014,MileKing,4.0,"Food here was incredible.  Perhaps the best steak I've had.  All the food was flavorful and exceptionally prepared.  But the place is in a casino, groups were plentiful, and thus very noisy. This quality of food in a quieter environment would be perfect.  Even so, the food was great and we will be back."
05/03/2014,Luvinit,4.0,"Amazing good, well prepared, well thought out specials and wine choices. Not thrilled that my request to have a quiet booth was not fulfilled but other than that, a spectacular dinner."
05/03/2014,JoeU,5.0,My wife and I have eaten at Michael Jordans numerous times and we have to say that we have never had anything bad at the restaurant. Service is always a pleasure and there wine list is tops. The garlic bread is my favorite as well as the porterhouse steak for two. Although the cost is on the upper side you are paying for a prime product. Would highly recommend it to anyone who love steaks as well as the other items on the menu.
05/03/2014,dtopar,3.0,"Even with a reservation, we had to wait over fifteen minutes for a table!"
05/02/2014,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"THE FOOD WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD, BETTER THAN RUTHS CHRIS!!!"
04/30/2014,Guy532,2.0,Filet was tough.  Asked for medium and it came out medium well.
04/30/2014,Princess,5.0,Kansas City Steak was awesome. So tasty and delicious!
04/28/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"My son chose this restaurant for his birthday. Expensive, but worth it for a special occasion. The food was delicious, from appetizer to dessert, and they gave him a special birthday cake too. We were both very happy and full."
04/28/2014,BrianF66,5.0,"5 star dining gem in the heart of Mohegan Sun.  Excellent service, great food.  Love the garlic bread appetizer."
04/27/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Excellent food, service an overal awesome expeience cant wait to come back"
04/26/2014,ldhurl,5.0,The food and service was exquisite and impeccable.
04/26/2014,Ken1,5.0,The meal was cooked to perfection.  The restaurant manager Ryan took interest in our service and the food that was prepared for us.  We mentioned we had a bad experience on our first visit and Ryan made sure our second visit was not a repeat of the first.  Asparagus was not on the menu but we asked and were told they did have them if we wanted them.  I would definitely return for a night out at MJR without waiting a year to return.
04/25/2014,JennyLynn,5.0,Love this place...the food is great and the service is fantastic!
04/24/2014,mcapril2004,4.0,"My wife and I ate here for our 10 year anniversary. It was our first visit. The food was unbelievable. We thoroughly enjoyed everything from the appetizer to the steaks and side dishes. It was nice that the side dishes were served family style so that we could share. While we declined dessert as we were full, the server brought over a small chocolate cake with a candle compliments of the restaurant for the special occasion. 

The only blemish, if you will, was the service. While our server was very nice, we had more of a conversation with the food runner who brought out both our appetizer and meals. Additionally, we heard a different server at the table next to us reading off the nightly specials, while our server did not."
04/21/2014,Linda,4.0,"Expensive, but worth it.  Side dishes are huge so plan to share.  Food is wonderful.  We weren't given a 'birthday dessert' however.  Perhaps it was because it was so busy."
04/20/2014,Patb,3.0,"My husband's steak was well done. He asked for medium. He didn't send it back because he didn't want to eat after we were finished.
Also, they only had one bottle of the wine we ordered.
We had a wonderful waiter named Jimmy."
04/19/2014,Desi,5.0,MJ'S was a fantastic experience all around but is most notable for how savory the food is.  Hands down-BEST FOOD around!!  Great place to take a date!
04/19/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"My husband and I were looking forward to dining here for a while. We finally decided to take an evening getaway and spend it at the casino with dinner at Michael Jordan's. Our server, Rachel, was wonderful. She was very knowledgable about the menu and made good recommendations when we asked her opinion. She was very attentive without hovering too much. The food was delicious (we had the crab cake and garlic bread for appetizer, and for dinner we had the filet mignon and porterhouse with mashed potato side). I would highly recommend this place to anyone!!"
04/18/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellent exsperance. I will be back again the wait staff were professional and friendly the food wow  melt in ur mouth
04/18/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Always a great experience when we dine here. Always come back and always beats our expectations
04/13/2014,g0sh0rte,5.0,Food was amazing and service was perfect. I would always come back and always recommend !!
04/13/2014,flwrgrl,4.0,The Crab cake was the best ever...All Crab no Breading ...DELICIOUS
04/13/2014,WestIndianDiva,4.0,I loved the food at the Michael Jordan Steakhouse and the service was excellent. It was a little noisy at time but that stopped after awhile. The mashed potatoes were nice and creamy and the Michael Jordan Punch was yummy I had three!!! There was only one thing I was disappointed with that was the 23 layer chocolate cake. Let me just say there was nothing chocolate about that cake it seemed like it was soaking in a tub of the strongest most bitter coffee in the world. I'm a tea drinker so you can imagine how awful I thought it tasted. Even the coffee drinkers at my table thought it was horrible. Other than that one thing I enjoyed my experience and would dine there again and recommend it to friends.
04/12/2014,SteakLover,3.0,"I had the best Ribeye from MJ's in NYC so I wanted to relive the foodie moment again for a very special rare date. Requested the Ribeye Medium Rare and it came out Medium. For a $50 steak you expect it cooked the way you want it. The sides were excellent and the waitress was terrific. Did not want to spoil the evening complaining, it's not an inexpensive dining experience so I'm disappointed."
04/12/2014,William1964,5.0,"took my wife there for our 16th wedding annv. and we had a great time. our waitress was awesome and food was great.we will be back .
thank you,
the Cassidy's"
04/12/2014,MJBerry,5.0,"MJ's Steakhouse is by FAR the best restaurant at Mohegan Sun. We have been to all of them many times and always come back to MJ's as our favorite. The Caesar salad is delicious. If you like beets, try the beet salad with goat cheese and hazelnuts. The crab cake is the best I've ever had! Most of the time, we get filet mignon which is wonderful. The service is always good Highly recommend!!"
04/12/2014,JBN1220,5.0,"The food and service were excellent. I am very glad we chose to eat here. For us, it is not a place we would go all the time as it is expensive but to celebrate my husbands birthday it was perfect and delicious."
04/12/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Usually my wife and I get tickets to a show at Mohegan we drive down and try and find a place to eat. Usually a Saturday, restaurants are busy and we are rushed to eat. Decided to try OpenTable and go to Michael Jordan's, internet site easy to navigate. Late arriving, email confirmation had the restaurants direct number, called and staff accommodating. Arrived and table was ready within minutes, staff were friendly, service quick but we were not rushed. I had steak and wife had scallops, both were excellent. Finished in more than enough time to walk around the building and help financially support the casino before our show! We would definitely recommend Michael Jordan's and the OpenTable reservation system worked very well for us."
04/05/2014,RachelH,4.0,"The service was outstanding & also very accommodating! Our waiter was excellent & very knowledgeable as well. I was however disappointed in the wine selection as I consider myself to be a wine connoisseur, & my steak which I had asked to be med/rare, was very much on the medium side. Overall though, the meal was very good & we enjoyed our menu selections. Again, the waitor was more than accommodating & brought catered to all of our special requests! If you are going to spend between the $200-$300 range as we did, I would recommend going to capital grill instead."
04/05/2014,Sirmam,4.0,Food and service both very good. Very noisy restaurant
04/05/2014,JohnS,5.0,"What a great meal , the booth tables set the scene for
Romantic evening."
04/04/2014,BBCC85,4.0,The filet was fantastic. They were cooked to perfection. Brussel sprouts were over cooked but would have been really good (with bacon and apple cider) if not burnt and cooked too long. Mushrooms sauté was exceptional. We went for a birthday and had a chocolate mouse cake for dessert. That was so-so. A little disappointing and dry but the creme brûlée was really good. Strong vanilla flavoring which we loved. Over all a delicious experience and I would recommend it. Not cheap. Over $120 a person with tip if you have a bottle of wine. It is worth it for a special occasion. If you love an exceptional cut of steak the filet is superb! They give you a steak knife but I swear it is so tender you could cut it with a butter knife.
03/30/2014,klaz07,5.0,"We really enjoyed our meal at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse. We started off with the garlic bread and blue cheese fondue and OH MY! This is a must buy. I don't even like blue cheese and this was fabulous. My husband and I both ordered the filet with a truffle parmesan crust and wow, it melted in our mouths. We shared a lobster mashed potatoes and again, wow!! If only we had room for more, I'm sure the dessert would have been just as good. Our servers were very helpful and came when appropriate.
Overall, amazing experience. This place never disappoints. I can't wait to go back. This place is right up there with all the really good steakhouses in Boston and NYC (even our neighbor table agreed)."
03/29/2014,tommy,5.0,great food tremendous waitress :) !
03/29/2014,NickDanger,4.0,The steaks were outstanding. Appitizers were outstanding. Salads were outstanding.
03/28/2014,TinaB,5.0,I would say that was one of the best steak I have ever eaten. Perfectly seasoned!! The crab cake was also delicious. Full if crab meat and light on the stuffing.
03/28/2014,MBray,5.0,It was a much overdue date night with my husband and not knowing the restaurant it was perfect. Counldn't have asked for better.
03/26/2014,Denise,1.0,For a steak house they need to hire a new cook-  everything was over cooked or undercooked very bad experience
03/25/2014,FoodLover,5.0,"The food was delicious, but the salad was a bit wilted with some brown leaves. Overall the meal was delicious and the servers were wonderful. The bread is out of this world!"
03/25/2014,Jayrot,4.0,"Went to Jordan's with a party of four, All had steak. 2 apps, 3 sides and two desserts. Every dish was delicious and hot. The server Jimmy was great. Looking forward to the next visit."
03/23/2014,Rockngrob13,5.0,I eat Crab Cakes all over the place especially in the Maryland bay are this crab cake at Michael Jordan's by far was the best by far I have ever eaten in my 35+ years of traveling and eating in many restaurants!!
03/22/2014,YonkersNative,4.0,"MJS was quite busy when we arrived...so much so that we had to wait beyond our reservation time. But our greeter did apologize for the delay. Our server Carrie did come afterwards and take our order. Again, it was a very busy evening so service was a little slow but once the food and drinks arrived everything was fine. My salad hit the spot and my Delmonico steak was cooked to perfection (medium); my party each ordered the filet mignon and it looked delicious. Our sides--garlic fries, mushrooms and creamed spinach--was more than enough for the three of us. No way we could have had dessert on this evening after a great meal! As expected, Michael Jordan's inside Mohegan Sun had a dark ambiance but it was also quite energetic. Good time!"
03/22/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Look no further! MJ's doesn't disappoint. We were adventurous and got the steak tartare-amazing.

The bacon appetizer is soooo worth it.

Steaks were perfectly cooked, lobster mashed potatoes were just as incredible as they sound...

You can 'to go wrong here! Save room for dessert, though. We didn't."
03/22/2014,EricG,5.0,"Great Service and Food! Had a private booth and was waited on hand and foot. Wife and I had a NY Strip and a Filet Mignon, which were both excellent. Sides were big enough for 2 big portions. This is a great place for a special occasion with family and friends!"
03/22/2014,MarciB,4.0,"Waitress was fantasti and very friendly. Both of our steaks for over cooked. For the price we paid, that was definitely disappointing."
03/22/2014,MattS,5.0,"I have had dinner at Michael Jordan's approximately 15 times. I have NEVER been disappointed. I always walk out of the restaurant thinking....""that was an incredible meal""."
03/21/2014,Hav2eat,5.0,"the blue cheese fondue garlic bread and the maple glazed bacon are two must try appetizers !! The Parmesan encrusted filet mignon with a topper of fresh crabmeat and asparagus drizzled with a brenaise sauce is absolutely awe inspiring !!! Add in the lobster mashed potatoes as a side, you won't be disappointed .... Once you've finished dinner and are thinking you can't possibly eat anything else force yourself too order the baked Alaska, I guarantee once you take your first taste your stomach will magically develop just enough room to finish dessert.. It's that good!!!"
03/19/2014,Clocker,5.0,"As usual, our steak dinners at Michael Jordan's were outstanding!
Service was friendly and courteous and professional.
We had a private booth which added to the dining experience.
We will definitely return in the near future."
03/15/2014,Lidia,2.0,"The food was overpriced but not that great; and the restaurant was really loud and crowded, it was hard to have a conversation with anyone. The service was good though."
03/15/2014,Poobaeh,4.0,"We had a very nice dinner. The KC Strip is delicious. I do not like fatty steaks and always get a filet. Very glad I trusted our server with his suggestion. My Pear Margarita was very nice. I had a second one! The sides are very large - great for sharing.

Very noisy and busy, so not very romantic."
03/14/2014,JoJo,3.0,We eat here whenever we go to Mohegan we always get the garlic bread which is out if this world but the delmonaco (sp?) steak which was disappointing this this time. It won't stop us from going back just hope it was a fluke!
03/11/2014,Shep,5.0,"I had arranged a birthday dinner for my wife and two long time family friends. Arrived at restaurant for a 7pm dinner. The table was ready on time and we were seated as soon as we arrived. All of the staff provided a relaxed, friendly and professional environment. We were Immediately offered cocktails and were left to chat for as long as we wanted. The waiter was attentive but not intrusive and we never felt rushed. The food and wine were superb and we spent about 3 hours at the table, eating and chatting. It was truly a great time and a wonderful experience. We would all definitely go back and would recommend MJ's to anyone for that special occasion."
03/09/2014,JBEB,5.0,Overall it was a wonderful experience. Both my wife and I had the filet for our main course and it was cooked to perfection. Both sides we ordered were delicious which were the mashed potatoes and the creamed spinach (the best we've ever had). For starters we went with the garlic bread with blue cheese fondue which was tasty! We split the ceasar salad which was plenty to share prior to the main course. On top of the delicious food the service was top notch!
03/09/2014,David,4.0,seems like restaurant may be under new management?
03/09/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Service is top notch and a great meal as always.
03/08/2014,DarleneG,3.0,Have bee here many times. We waited 15 minutes to be seated. We had a 6:45 reservation and did not get sat till 7pm. Was very busy this last time and I ordered the Kansas city steak. The steak was served very under done and had no taste. Service was slow. I did not enjoy my dining experience this last time I was there.
03/08/2014,Richard,4.0,We were seated right on time for our reservation. Great food and service. The staff were very conscious of my wife's gluten free sensitivity.
03/08/2014,March8,2.0,"I rated this fair due to a few reasons, 1st the only reason we went to MJ's was we were notified that we had Dining points on our moumoment card. When the bill came, we asked our waiter to used our points. He only used our earned points not the Dining points that had to be used March 9. So we lost a total of $55.00 of Dining points that we earned. Bacon appetizer was very tough. The scallops were blain. The New York Strip was very good, but for the price, we would not go back."
03/08/2014,mjfan,5.0,Was thrilled with our fast service so we could enjoy our meal and still make it to the arena in time for the game.Loved the steak and was surprised at the big chunks of lobster in the lobster mashed potatoes. It was almost like a surf and turf. The waitstaff were attentive even though the place was crazy busy. Side portions were as advertised: enough for two. Loved the dessert menu and the one I chose was the perfect ending for my meals..
03/08/2014,Sari,5.0,"We went with 7 people during a convention at the Mohegan. The staff was extremely accommodating, especially the ladies at the podium. Some of our party was running late and they had no problem taking care of us. Our servers were Jimmy, Justin and their'shadow', Taylor. They did a terrific job. We ordered appetizers of the freshest oysters, salads and tuna tartare - all were yummy. Then we ordered 3 steaks for 2 - 2 'Tomahawk' 53oz bone-in rib eyes and 1 T-bone for 2. They were all HUGE. Our rib eye could easily serve 4 people! The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and absolutely delicious. The creamed spinach was incredible. For dessert we had the 23 layer chocolate cake, baked Alaska and creme brulee. Thanks for a special night, MJ!"
03/02/2014,Nana,5.0,Food and service was wonderful as a first timer
03/02/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Been there many times and they never disappoint.
03/02/2014,Johnny1971,5.0,Great place our Waitress Laura was fantastic as well as Nick the team server at our table. THE BACON WAS AMAZING. Great Job!
03/02/2014,JeffreyS,5.0,"Overall, a really good steakhouse. Try the garlic bread with blue cheese fondue app. Outstanding. I had the bone in rib-eye and my girlfriend had the Filet. Both were excellent."
03/01/2014,Kdna,5.0,"We went to Michael Jordans Steak House at the Mohegan Sun and had a wonderful experience! We went to celebrate a special night, my son's 16th birthday. The food is amazing, the service is incredible - our waitress was great!-and at the end of the dinner they gave my son a surprise dessert for his birthday. I would highly recommend this restaurant for a special night out (a little expensive for our budget for it just a typical night out). I hope to have something to celebrate soon so we can go again!"
03/01/2014,James,5.0,The food and service at MJ is always wonderful. The menu is sufficient to satisfy wide range of tastes. And the steaks are incredible. The noise level is excellent to allow conversation without having to shout. Yet enough noise to have a pleasant ambiance. It is always a pleasure to have dinner there.
03/01/2014,H8tobl8,4.0,Our service was fantastic. Food was a little sub par for the price. Steak quality did not seem to be Prime.
03/01/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We had an amazing meal at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse. The service was exceptional and noteworthy. The meal was delicious with perfectly grilled meats. My twin daughters and thier friend shared the porterhouse, my husband had the special strip steak of the day which was aged perfectly and I had two fabulous lamb chops. The sides were also delicious. They even sent out a massive, towering piece of cake after my daughter inadvertently brushed her hand on the handle of the bubbling and creamy mac and cheese cast iron pan. We savored and laughed and enjoyed a perfect meal. We were not rushed at all. We highly recommend this spot for those visiting Mohegan Sun!"
03/01/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,If your looking for a high end steak house you can't go wrong with mj's.
03/01/2014,Erin,5.0,This place never fails to deliver! Love it!
02/28/2014,karemel,5.0,Great service and the food was delicious. The only way it could have been better would be that Michael Jordan was sitting with us or that I won a ton at the casino. Great dinner from appetizers to dessert. Can't wait to go again.
02/28/2014,RobD,5.0,"My wife and I dine at MJ Mohegan every time we visit the casino, and it never disappoints. The service is unfailingly excellent and the food is very good. While they hit all of the steakhouse classics, they also keep the menu fresh. The steak tartare app that had been added since our last visit was terrific. We typically share a porterhouse and an order of creamed spinach and these were, as usual, perfect.
If I were to nit pick, I would say the Caesar salad was fine, appropriately seasoned and dressed, but lacking the extra special punch that dishes out of this kitchen consistently exhibit. We would have been very happy with it from another restaurant, but it was ever so slightly below the expectations for this fine restaurant."
02/22/2014,nancycrg,5.0,My husband and I come here for our birthdays. This past Saturday we went and it was delicious as usual. He had a nice steak and I had king crab legs that were the best I every had - tender and tasty! We get the tuna tartare appetizer every time we go also. We will be coming back for my birthday in May!
02/21/2014,JoeM,4.0,Server was excellent. Definetly added to the whole experience. I would reccomend this restaurant to all my friends.
02/21/2014,Underperformer,5.0,Go here any chance you get when you're at the casino. Delicious!
02/17/2014,kpitt,4.0,"We had reservations at 7pm and waited about 10 minutes for a table. The restaurant was quite busy but we were attended to very quickly after being seated. The food was very good overall, but I would skip the 23-layer chocolate cake. It was quite dry and not tasty at all."
02/16/2014,PleasantvalleyMark,5.0,"Took my wife, older son and girlfriend. Best filet Mignon I ever had. The crab cake is huge, and not deal fried. It is just huge chunks of crap, just excellent. Make sure you order the lobster mashed potatoes, and the corn. It is a bit pricey, but that is the kind of resturant it is, and worth it."
02/16/2014,JP1817,4.0,The oysters were delicious and the steak was very good. Probably the best steak place in the area.
02/16/2014,Hopefate,5.0,"Our server knew the menu so well to fully describe each entree. Mike D., thanks for our wonderful evening."
02/15/2014,TLFarino,3.0,"Went here before a concert at the hotel and it was very good overall.  Food was excellent (just like the NYC spot) and they had a great wine list.  Server was very accommodating when I didn't like my first cocktail and I wanted to change to wine.  Hostesses were a little offputting, but it could have been because the place was packed and there were people waiting everywhere...so make a reservation!"
02/15/2014,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Outstanding service and awesome food.
02/15/2014,hogaboom,4.0,"My wife and I have 4 children,for us to go to MoheganSun and get to go to Michael Jordans was a rare treat. The food was great, the service also. My only complaint was, we only had 8 to 10 minutes between our salad arriving and the entree. Making us feel very rushed! The waiter explained what happened and apologized profusely. Yet, it put a damper on an otherwise wonderful night."
02/14/2014,FilC,4.0,"very good, a little pricey, but Great Food"
02/14/2014,Soop,4.0,"The steaks were great! Our appetiser and side vegie great as well. The ambiance was nice, however, we were seated on the aisle near a busy server walkway..:( We had a reservation, just bad luck with that.

Our only disappointment was the wine list. It was extensive, but extremely expensive. We could only find 1-2 bottles at 50-60.00 which is already a bit much for us. The rest of the wine was 75.00 or more. A few pages of wine in the hundreds of dollars. I don't think the restaurant is that upscale to match the wine list. The bottle of cab that we did get; definetly didn't taste like a 50.00 bottle !"
02/14/2014,Kimberly,5.0,"Best meal I've had in a long time! Although a la carte, sides are huge. Truffle fries are to die for. Snow crab legs were sweet and tender. My husband, who is very picky, devoured his prime rib. Service was great. Prices are high, but worth it. Make a reservation!"
02/14/2014,JeffP,5.0,"We were seated at a booth along the wall, surrounded by cushioned walls. It's an inviting, comfortable restaurant; definitely upscale, but without pretense. We started with the bacon appetizer which was thick, smoky bacon with a chewy candy-like coating-simply delicious. For entrees, I had the filet topped with deviled crab. My wife had the free-range chicken. Both dishes were cooked to perfection. The filet was so tender it could be cut with a spoon. The chicken was tender and juicy with a crispy edge. For sides, we shared the corn which was sweet and delicious with a late spicy kick. The Yukon gold mashed potatoes were good, but nothing special. We spent $150 with no alcohol or dessert. Pricey, but for a special occasion; a great treat."
02/14/2014,dlussier,5.0,This was a wonderful dining experince that we would truly do again.The food was amazing as well as the service we received..It made our day very special!!

02/13/2014,nolimit,5.0,"The food was excellent. Cooked to perfection! Every time I go I am never disappointed. The atmosphere, the food, the presentation are top notch."
02/09/2014,6arcia,5.0,"My wife and I celebrated our ""dating"" anniversary and enjoyed the Filet Mignon, New York Strip, mash potatoes and mac&cheese. The Filet Mignon is deceivingly filling, both meats were cooked the way we asked and we loved it. Sides were delicious and EXTREMELY filling. Overall great meal and atmosphere, the service is one of the best we have experienced.

This place had great energy and heavily staffed so you are not waiting. Try to avoid dining near a work station though if you mind the traffic while you are eating. The busier the place is, the busier the workstation."
02/08/2014,GinnyM,3.0,"We read the reviews and the majority wrote that the food was great but the service not so much. We figured that had to be wrong. Lesson learned - trust the reviews ! The food was great but the service lackluster. To top it off, the waiter ""lost"" my credit card. After some urging to check around a bit more, he finally found it. All I got was (literally) "" my bad"". How I hate that expression."
02/08/2014,George,4.0,This was my second time at MJs. Both times the food was great and the atmosphere was nice. The service was very good.. All that being said it was still a bit pricey. My wife and I paid $250 for two of us.
02/04/2014,SuzyQ,5.0,"I have eaten at a few Michael Jordan's Restaurants, and this location is tops! Here you can count on a great steak cooked to perfection, with delicious sides. The wine list is impressive as well. Service is attentive. This place ranks in my top 3 favorite restaurants!"
02/03/2014,PCSr,5.0,My husband and the free range chicken and I had the rack of lamb. Both were excellent. Will definitely return and highly recommend.
02/02/2014,Wegs,5.0,"Everything was A+, must include in mohegan sun visit"
02/02/2014,SteakMe,2.0,"I've gone to Michael Jordan's both here and the NYC locations many many times and have found my most recent visit what I've been feeling all along, the restaurant is declining in quality. From the host station where there used to be professionals that are now fairly clueless kids, to a server who in spite of writing our order down managed to both forget my cocktail and screw up the entrees. When the steaks came back, they were clearly the same steaks just washed off (they put the wrong crust on my steak- when I received it, it was overcooked with no dicernable seasoning). Overall, they're clearly not trying."
02/01/2014,Pops,5.0,"My boyfriend and I went to Michael Jordan's before a concert at Mohegan Sun. We had a great experience from the wine, to the food, to our excellent waiter, Anthony. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone."
02/01/2014,KPK21,5.0,Always a great meal at MJ's ! The Staff makes the difference ! Make it a point to spend your next special night at MJ's !
02/01/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"This was second time dining at Michael Jordan's. It is definitely a little on the pricier side, but the food is worth every penny. Our waitress was great and our food was just outstanding."
01/26/2014,vanessa,4.0,"The food here is very good. The portions are big. The filet mignon ordered rare was OK. The mac and cheese side dish was to die for, so rich and creamy. The roasted beet salad had a great mixture of tastes and textures. The rib-eye was huge as was the caesar salad.
OK, service was only so-so. Our waitress, Jennifer, talked way too fast and seemed to want to spend as little time with us as she could. Her assistant or side-kick (as he described himself), Jorge, was very attentive. Also, I noticed the manager stopping at some tables but never checked in with us.
The table we were seated at was right next to the kitchen and kind of on a corner so that people, waiters and customers, kept crashing into my chair.
The experience was OK."
01/26/2014,Katie,4.0,"Salmon was excellent as were our sides- asparagus and Yukon mashed. Thought the house salad needed a pick me up, but it was good. My husband had the garlic bread and they even made it half portion so I wouldn't be tempted- it's always very good and a must try."
01/26/2014,Perfect,5.0,Excellent food! well served in a great atmosphere. Would highly recommend

01/25/2014,EDWARDS52,3.0,"MICHAEL JORDANS ALWAYS HAS GIVEN US A GOOD DINNER. UNFORTUNATELY THE NOISE LEVEL IS WAY TOO LOUD!!!!
I THINK THE CASINO YOU CAN GHEAR YOUR FRIENDS IN BETTER!!! GREAT SERVICE, BUT NEED TOO GET BACKGROUND MUSIC OR DO SOMETHING TO MAKE IT A MORE RELAXING MEL."
01/24/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Omg! The server, Rob was phenomenal! The food was even better! We had, filet mignon, scallops, roasted chicken w lobster! I'm literally ready to book my next reservation! Oh, and my dirty martini came w stuffed blue cheese and hot peppers! The best thing ever!"
01/24/2014,Bagger56,3.0,"You can never complain about the food which was great. The Delmonico was perfectly marbles, cooked and flavored. My wife really enjoyed a newer item the Salmon. Side dishes could use a little update as they have been the same for ever and are limited as it is. They are great just need better choices.

The service is a little slow and our server Kerrie was just not real friendly given the expectations here. There was no smiling at all, no thank you even when she finally brought the check. Despite letter her know we were heading to a show, she took over 5 minutes to run our credit card after dinner. Honestly she just seemed really bord with the whole thing.

At these prices, ask to meet your server before sitting down."
01/24/2014,Enjoy2dine,5.0,Great tasting food. Loved the Garlic Bread appetizer. The atmosphere was relaxing yet romantic. The staff was helpful and very attentive all night. I will definitely return to this restaurant as well as highly recommend it to friends.
01/23/2014,Mutt,5.0,We love this place. The service was fabulous ! The food was excellent and menu has choices for everyone ! Thank you for making our night special!
01/23/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,A must eat at every time I go to the casino. And if you don't get the garlic bread you have not lived!
01/19/2014,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Good service and great food.The Crab Cake is the Best in the East.
01/19/2014,TommyT,4.0,MJ's is a bit pricey but the steaks are mostly aged prime beef and I've never had a bad meal there.
01/18/2014,LoveWine,5.0,"The food was excellent and the service was great. Great atmosphere, perfect for date night or for a night out with friends."
01/18/2014,JimL,5.0,"We have been here previously and it remains a favorite. While a bit pricey, the service, food, and ambience was stellar. I had the fillet and my wife had scallops. We managed a surf and turf that was superb. The side of mushrooms was perfectly seasoned. Really enjoyed it!"
01/18/2014,willbeback,5.0,The steaks were cooked to perfection. Service was wonderful. Will be back again.
01/18/2014,Sarafaye,5.0,"Let me preface this review by saying, I am not a red-meat eater. But I have been so thoroughly blown away by what I have had over the years, that I enjoy taking my carnivorous friends knowing that I will always find something yummy on the menu. For my visit to Mohegan, this was my top choice. I had amazing balsamic crusted scallops and a side of grill corn. My date had the NY Strip. Everything was wonderful! Our server had the unfortunate job of refusing liquor service to the table next to us, so we left a tip for her that they declined to leave. My only complaint is that the reservation was scheduled noting my birthday and I didn't get any cake! This is the only place you need to eat for your trip to the casino!"
01/18/2014,Elissa,5.0,Everything was amazing! I am sad I waited so long to dine at Michael Jordan's! Can't wait to go back! The crab cake is to die for!
01/15/2014,Thunder,5.0,"the food was superb - we had a variety from the menu from steak to seafood...all were excellent...the service was responsive, professional, informed, friendly without being cloying- a nice evening ( the drinks and the wine were 'fine')"
01/12/2014,jorge,5.0,excellent and delicious food. the service is very accomodating!!
01/10/2014,MBaldy,5.0,Very expensive but well worth it.
01/06/2014,FlyingRICPA,4.0,If you are lucky enough to go to Michael Jordan's - be sure and get the garlic bread - it is infused with blue cheese and comes with a blue cheese fondue that will having you contemplating licking the plate in public. The lobster mashed potatoes are also a personal favorite. I have never had anything here that wasn't fabulous.
01/04/2014,prettyfair,4.0,"We went to dinner this past Saturday night at MJ Steakhouse at Mohegan Sun. The restaurant was quite busy, however we were a party of four and had made a reservation. We were prompty seated and our wait staff was great. The food was great....my salmon was a bit over-cooked, but otherwise all was fine. The sides at this restaurant have gotten smaller and their dinner prices have gotten larger. Overall, the ambience is great, however when you order one appetizer to share, no desserts and only 2 half bottles of their moderate wine and your bill (with tip) is over $400, you leave there saying huh and was that worth it....My recommendation is to eat on the sport bar side!! Same quality food but far more reasonable!!"
01/01/2014,T1025,4.0,"Place was packed on NYE and I kept checking open table in hopes of finding a cancelation. And I did!!! I was so excited to find a reservation at MJ's Steakhouse within a 10 min window, otherwise I might have ended up at a packed food court.
Service was excellent and so was the food."
01/01/2014,Sandy,3.0,"I would not recommend this place for New Year's Eve, if dinner is after 9:00 PM. The music from the DJ below the restaurant was way too loud. The bass used in all the music was turned up so high and created such a rumble in the air making this a very disappointing experience."
01/01/2014,Ellie,4.0,Steak is steak. They need to come up with something to make their dinners stand out from ALL the other high end steak houses. Their bar menu is more creative & the food more satisfying.
12/31/2013,Patsy,5.0,Delicious melt in your mouth steaks and tasty sides.. Loved crab cake appetizer..Cozy atmosphere.. Service we'll paced..cozy atmosphere..corner table felt private..
12/31/2013,LenR,5.0,My wife and I had a great romantic dinner for New Years eve. The meal and the service was outstanding.
12/31/2013,Lmab,5.0,"We had a wonderful meal, there were 4 of us and we all ordered steak but three different varieties. Each was excellent. We started with the garlic bread with blue cheese sauce which was delicious and then had three different sides. The roasted corn was fabulous! A great atmosphere and great meal with family. Spectacular!"
12/31/2013,CarolB,5.0,"Dinner was fabulous, our server's recommendation for dinner and our sides was marvoulous.
We were not going to have dessert and our server Michael recommended that we have the baked Alaska,
He said that if we didn't like it we wouldn't have to pay...well we loved it!!!
Best New Year's Eve dinner!!!"
12/31/2013,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"IIt took 15 minutes before anyone waited on us. The appetizer & salad were good but dinner was not worth the price. The restaurants roving big wig asked how the dinner was. My wife told him that her chicken was salty. His comment was I'm sorry and he walked away. The waitress asked me to cut my steak to check if it was cooked right ,I told her good but I had not tried it yet. The Garlic French Fries were too salty. I ordered a $48 Delmonico thinking a nice tender steak, you would think a Prime cut $48 Delmonico would melt in your mouth but this was not the case. I've had a lot better at Outback. We had coffee and we sent that back too, it tasted watered down. I will never go here again. I should have gone to Bobby Flays!!"
12/31/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellent New Year's Eve dinner!
12/30/2013,kath,4.0,I found using open table for making reservations very convenient...MJSteakhouse is wonderful but not easy for reservations...so thanks!
12/30/2013,LiRu,5.0,My second time to this restaurant for ladies night. We started with garlic bread w/ blue cheese fondue. Excellent! We all had the filet which was cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth. Our favorite side is the lobster mashed potatoes. You actually get chunks of lobster and you can taste the lobster flavor throughout the potatoes as well. Michael (not Jordan) was our server and he was on the spot.
12/29/2013,George,4.0,It was very good.. Reservations highly recommended...ours were on time but we found a seat at the bar and ate there .. Overall a very good experience. A bit pricey but worth it
12/29/2013,DRRJR,5.0,"We had a great dinner here on a busy Saturday night. We had a reservation for two and we were sat right away. The server was attentive and recommended the garlic bread as an appetizer. We went with the tuna tartar anyway, and it was delicious. My husband had the delmonico, and he loved it. It came with a balsamic dipping sauce and was great with or without it. I had the filet minion, also delicious. Both steaks were cooked to our liking. We had the corn side dish. It had a bit of spice and a great crunch. Obviously, it's expensive, so don't go looking for a bargain. It's also super loud, but we sat side-by-side which helped. Overall, I recommend the place during a visit to Mohegan Sun."
12/28/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Make sure to ask for a booth - it was pretty loud! Other wise, stellar!"
12/28/2013,Dflowers28,5.0,"My girlfriend surprised me and took me to the Prince concert on 12/28/2013 at Mohegan Sun and booked dinner at MJ Steakhouse. Great food, service and ambiance! I totally recommend it!"
12/28/2013,Chili,5.0,Took a chance and had a late dinner while visiting Mohegan Sun casino. The food was outstanding! Dined the next night at Bar Americain and I wanted to tell the chef to go next door to see how it's done. Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about food and wine selections. We would definitely dine there again.
12/25/2013,Leslie,3.0,Food was very good…. Steak came out over cooked.. they brought it back… Manager never came over to apologize. When the steak then came out it was under cooked. I was scared to send it back…
12/24/2013,Dave,3.0,"It has clearly slipped from its old days, although the service was excellent. To spend $270.00 for three dinners is just too much!"
12/23/2013,paulieboy,2.0,"First time we ate here everything was very good. This time, not so good. My Delmonico was taken back twice to be redone. First time overcooked, second time undercooked. What came back the 3rd time was overcharred. I ate it but did not enjoy it. Sides were okay, nothing great."
12/22/2013,Linda,5.0,"We always go there, but this was my daughters first time. We took her for her birthday she was amazed on well the steak cut without using a knife & melted in her mouth. All of the steaks were perfect."
12/21/2013,Nancy,3.0,"We went to MJ's for a special holiday dinner for my daughter returning from Hong Kong for Christmas. The place was very noisy and busy. Our meal took well over 45 minutes to arrive.Our server apologized saying that a party of 50 had ordered at the same time and it set everything back. Do I really care? Food quality is aways good here, although overpriced. The staff was hopping and very busy. We were seated in close proximity to the bar, which was almost intolerable, noise-wise."
12/20/2013,Hard2please,5.0,"THE best steak I ever had! And I mean EVER! We have been to many high end steak restaurants including Smith and Wolenski, and Ruth Chris. Comfortable, quiet and delicious! Knowledgeable helpful waitress . Expensive, but worth every penny! The garlic bread was to die for! We were there for an important birthday celebration and the food couldn't have been better!"
12/20/2013,TheChief,5.0,"Been to Jordan's several times, never had a bad meal. Filet's done to perfection, asked for Asparagus which was not on the menu, but they had it, outstanding service from waitress Sheena. Highly recommend this place!"
12/20/2013,H8tobl8,3.0,We checked in early and they said 30 mins. When we got there in 30 mins they said 5 mins. We we seated 15 minutes after that. We felt like we were not important to them. They were not booked up 100%. Cannot figure why this wait was necessary.
12/19/2013,Bommertw,5.0,"I proposed to my girlfriend here. I wouldn't consider MJ's Steakhouse the quintessential place to do it, but it definitely was adequate. Our waitress brought over 2 glasses of champagne afterwards without prompting her. The food was amazing. I will absolutely come back for their food."
12/19/2013,Tcurrie,5.0,The filet melts in your mouth....delicious like usual. Can't wait to return!!
12/19/2013,TrvlSnobs,4.0,"The first time we ate there last year, the food was excellent. This time the scallops were way too salty. The beet salad was very good. The meal came very quickly after the champagne and apps. The waiter noticed it too and sincerely apologized. The veggie of the day, sauteed Brussel sprouts were really horrible. The desert was v good and the waiter brought us a complimentary champagne and a mini lava cake desert for the birthday toast and to smooth things over. The waiter was excellent. We'll try it 1 more time"
12/17/2013,goldrush,4.0,"2 beet salads, a filet, a 1 1/2 lb lobster, a side of rosemary crispy potatoes for under 100 bucks. Good value, good food, great service. I will recommend"
12/13/2013,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Good service, food was good. Garlic app was awesome, Kansas City Strip special was very good."
12/08/2013,Sandra,3.0,"The food was amazing. I had the special which was a crabmeat stuffed lobster. Although our waitress was nice, she was slow and we waited for our apps for quite a long time while the surrounding tables (two of which got there after us) had already gotten and eaten their apps.
She was good after that."
12/08/2013,Dinner4two,4.0,"Dinner was delicious- ordered garlic bread fondue, wedge salad, filet mignon, creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. Service was great and atmosphere was nice. Would dine here again."

12/08/2013,Foody,3.0,"I have been here before but this time it was so loud it was tough to hear my date! Also, the food was just ok...and for the price I was not impressed. The wine was so expensive that we didn't even have more than one glass of wine. I would not go back any time soon"
12/08/2013,Wonderful,5.0,"Great food, great company. Costly, but worth it for a special evening."
12/08/2013,EricR,5.0,Place is so awesome!! Lobster mashed potatoes were unbelievable!
12/07/2013,DLamandDarc,5.0,"My wife and I ""LOVE"" Michael Jordan's Restaurant. When we think of that place, its the good Martini's and Garlic Bread w/blue cheese fondu. Steaks are also REALLY GOOD - only so-so one we've had is the Porter House for two.....it was over done - but who knows, maybe just a bad night for that. U can't go wrong with the filet mignon, and the bone-in ribeye w/truffle glaze. Expensive meal, but honestly worth the money."
12/07/2013,Nishikia,5.0,"The food is divine! My moscato was top notch, and there is such an amazing atmosphere here! Very romantic place too. If you're doing a night out with your special someone there is no better place!! Service is great! Staff is so attentive and considerate and even on a busy weekend evening they NEVER try and rush you out after your bill is paid. Great vibe all around. I love absolutely everything about this restaurant and I highly recommend it to all!!"
12/06/2013,GoodFoodGal,5.0,"We have eaten here multiple times and the food is always phenomenal. The porterhouse for 2, double smoked bacon appetizer, blue cheese fondue garlic break, grilled corn, and lobster mashed potatoes were superb. The steak simply melts in your mouth and had a black truffle Parmesan crust on it. All quite decadent and a real treat."
11/30/2013,Daboston,5.0,"Great service and usuall the food was top notch. Our waiter was exceptional, when we ordered our salads we
Asked to have our salad before we decided on our main course, other restuarunts would have rushed us into
Ordering the main course, but it was to be able to relax have a salad then order. Our waiter had no problem with this
Dry aged bond in strip steak was tasty and cooked to perfection. The filet was too rare, they offered to cook it a little longer but it was already chared, they offered a new steak with no problem. This usually doesn't work out well as the person waits while everyone eats, but our new steak was at our table and cooked perfect.
A great time.."
11/30/2013,EdGen,5.0,Always a great meal and romantic spot! Highly recommended for a special occasion.
11/30/2013,burgerguy,5.0,"Food, service and timing were excellent; the wine list is pricey."
11/29/2013,DaveA,4.0,"Nice place... I'm not a big fan of servers as second waiter... service suffers... see above over all
Food was very good"
11/28/2013,Retired,3.0,"My salmon was very good. Turkey meal was average, cranberry sauce was sour. Server appeared new. Glad we had specified a booth, tables were very close together. Not recommended (by me) for a romantic, quiet dinner, too noisy. Seated promptly at reservation time. It's nice to be closed off from the casino floor without machines/gaming. I am not a steak eater but people rave about their steaks. Will try one next time."
11/28/2013,RBFHULL,3.0,"Great ambience and atmosphere, holiday dinner was a bit disappointing though. Mediocre food and service."
11/24/2013,MadDog,2.0,"I used to enjoy going to this restaurant. Food is still terrific and the service is, also. On Saturday night, I realized it has changed into a hangout. Kids used to hang out at the bar next door, which is fine. You could go into the restaurant with a date and have a wonderful evening. On Saturday I saw kids going in to eat with baseball caps on backwards, wearing t-shirts, and then being very loud and boisterous, almost out of control with their friends at the dinner tables. The food was still fine, but if this is now turning into a 20-something hangout, I will certainly go elsewhere. I spent $200 on dinner and left feeling like I could not wait to get out of there."
11/24/2013,UnoCamino,4.0,Sure the place might break the bank a little but it truly is an experience. Great food (steaks) that can be customized and appetizers and sides that can be shared. Extensive wine list offers some very good pairing opportunities.
11/23/2013,ShaneS,5.0,"Food was delicious. You have to get the garlic bread! Service was great!

I put in the comments when I made the reservation that it was our anniversary. We endedup not ggetting dessert because we were so full, but they gave us a little mocha chocolate cake with a candle in it for free because it was our anniversary. I did not ask for it and did not expect it. Thank you for that!"
11/23/2013,SLbergen,4.0,Restaurant is a little dark but food was exceptional.
11/17/2013,OpenTable Diner,3.0,A bit pricey - however the bone in ribeye was deliciously prepared as well as the side's - except the wedge salad which was a wasted order.
11/17/2013,lovetodine,5.0,We loved the relaxed atmosphere. The wait staff are friendly and professional. The bleu cheese garlic bread is a great starter! All the steaks are fantastic and always cooked perfectly. and the lobster mashed potatoes go with anything.
11/17/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Everything was delicious except we were dissapointed with the lobster Mac n cheese. In addition the side was not listed on the menu since it was new and our waitress didn't mention the price. When the check came I saw the side was $29 we both shocked. Understood that it was not to our liking but then to charge $29 for a side was just ridiculous.
11/16/2013,Nina,5.0,Steak is amazing! Always a good meal.
11/16/2013,crosswordmom,5.0,There were 6 of us and each had a different dinner. The food was exquisite from the first appetizer to the dessert. We love this place.
11/15/2013,Deedums,5.0,2nd time we have been here and it was terrific as it was the 1st time. Would eat here again and recommend to everyone.
11/15/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,The food was very good. I would say the service stood out the most. They were extremely quick. You never needed to look for them to come bring you something.
11/10/2013,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Seem to have a unexperienced waitress, and steak was over cooked :(
that's all i wanted to eat not happy"
11/10/2013,wannabet,5.0,"Great food, service, ambiance . Room between tables , not packed in. Relaxed dining not rushed. The staff was very helpful and great service. Very attentive ."

11/08/2013,April,5.0,Annual traditional event - we love your restaurant!
11/08/2013,josephmpalladino,5.0,We always love going here particularly to celebrate a special event. The Blue cheese bread appetizer and the Kit Kat dessert alone are worth a visist. This particular night our server Sheena was really great engaging and efficient. The veal chop I had was very good.
11/06/2013,Clocker,5.0,"We always enjoy the outstanding service and wonderful steaks at Michael Jordan's.
Our waiter was very attentive to our needs and our special requests.
The Porterhouse steak was delicious and cooked perfectly!
The manager (Kerry) was also very friendly and accommodating.
We will definitely return to MJ's in the very near future."
11/03/2013,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"a little too expensive given that you have to pay for all accompaniments. The mashed potatoes were too salty. No bread, although another table asked for it and they received it. I also could not believe how many people wore beatup jeans when it specifically says what the attire is. Otherwise the food was good."
11/03/2013,LaurenL,4.0,"I have been to this restaurant many times and always had a fabulous meal. This past visit was no exception, however, the restaurant was very crowded and the service was really slow, particularly for the entrée. At these prices, one would think management would plan ahead when they are anticipating such a crowd."
11/02/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We started our meal with a bottle of chianti and their garlic flatbread with blue cheese dipping sauce, both of which were wonderful. My husband and I split the porterhouse for 2 and my sister and her husband each got a filet mignon. We each finished our steaks - they were perfectly cooked to order and high quality. We shared a few sides: macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes, and the seasonal vegetable which was baby carrots with spinach - we loved them all. No room for dessert at the end - we were stuffed, but the options were tempting! I will definitely go back."
10/29/2013,Deee,5.0,"this was a birthday occasion and it was all it could be. I especially enjoyed the politeness & promptness, our server displayed."
10/28/2013,MillerOdukwe,2.0,"After countless times dining at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse in Mohegan Sun casino, I decided to bring my boyfriend for his birthday. He ordered the filet medium-well. The filet then came out over well and very dry. Not to mention, extremely crispy on the outside. This was not the first time that has happened. The last time I went I had the same experience but I figured I would give them another chance. Traveling an hour to have a nice dinner turned out to be not so good. I The wait staff and manager was very nice but the experience with the steak for the second time just turned me completely off now. I feel that when dining at an expensive upscale restaurant, even if the order is not perfect, it needs to be close to it!"
10/26/2013,Jeff22192,3.0,"The rest was just okay. Not a great value for the price. The porterhouse came already sliced, which was good. The Caesar salad should either be fixed or just removed from the menu it was a tasteless disaster.

Waitstaff was friendly but could use some formal training. Good experience but you can get the same with better and service at a Ruth Chris."
10/26/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We had Ribeye's, which were cooked perfectly and seasoned very well. our side was creamed spinach and this was becasue we wanted a little old school steakhouse side, also, very good."
10/26/2013,Amanda,4.0,"Went for a belated birthday celebration, good was outstanding, and the mixed drinks were great, not weak at all. It was very busy so it took our waiter a few minutes to get to us, but the food came out on time, and we really didn't spend that much money. Well
Worth every penny, and the crab cake is a must have! The sides are big enough to share so it's really no big deal that they are al a carte."
10/26/2013,Love2Eat,5.0,The steaks melt in your mouth! the Garlic bread is amazing!! We loved the entire experience... can't wait to return!
10/25/2013,Jela,5.0,I have never had a better meal! It was worth the 3 hour drive!
10/25/2013,bonjovifan,5.0,The food was delicious and friendly service.
10/25/2013,OHIO,5.0,As always a great meal with fantastic service. MJ's never disappoints and when taking in a show is always the best way to start the evening!
10/25/2013,Chris,5.0,"The Filet Mignon was excellent! The Macaroni and Cheese was made in a way you would never have thought. They made Macaroni and Cheese look so elegant! It was so good! We sat in a half circle booth in the wall, so our dining experience was very romantic. The service was great and the food came out quick, but they wait for you to finish your appetizers or salads first. I have no complaints at all."
10/18/2013,FoxyDiner,5.0,We visit here at least once a month to visit with my inlaws. I always have my three year old daughter with me and the servers are SOOOOO accommodating! They get out our appetizers right away and are more than happy to go out of their way for her. Our last waiter was no exception. He was super nice and really went out of his way for my family. We will be back soon!
10/14/2013,LuWest,5.0,"Lobster mashed and tower of garlic bread are outrageous. Best steaks ever. Had the sea scallops and some
Of the best. We are ocean side often and have great seafood but these scallops were some of the best."
10/14/2013,merky,4.0,The service was just good. The food was excellent.
10/14/2013,GirlsNightOut,1.0,"Girls night out went bad at this restaurant. We were seated and nobody came to our table for 25 minutes. At that time we ordered drinks. 10 minutes later the waiter came and took our orders for appetizers. The drinks and apps came to the table at the same time, now close to an hour after we sat down. Apps were all delicious and we were optimistic the rest of the experience would be okay. Then dinner came, a steak for two ordered rare came medium well and the manager actually argued that it was rare. Insane. The veal was over cooked and too dry to eat. Main course overall paled in comparison to the appetizers. We walked out annoyed and hungry. Will never go back there and would never recommend this place to anyone."
10/13/2013,TheBurningMan,4.0,"amazing steak! wonderful wine. server monique, stoic and matter of fact, has been at her job too long and takes it for granted :-(. busboy was a peach and friendly to all."

09/29/2013,DeeDee,5.0,Had a wonderful dinner. Can't wait to go back. Beautiful dining area. Very posh.
09/28/2013,luvfood,5.0,Great steaks!! Filet mignon and Rib-eye were delicious and the seasonal mushroom side dish was a great compliment and not competition. Topping it off with the 23 layer cake and the hot chocolate cake was the 'icing on the cake'. Great service and wonderful atmosphere too!
09/28/2013,DebraB,4.0,"I always try to go to Michael Jordan's when I am at Mohegan Sun. The food is very good and the staff are extremely service oriented. My only complaint is the noise level can be overwhelming depending on where in the restaurant you are sititng. If you are with a group of people, that may not matter, but if you want a romantice dinner with another person or are with a small group, it can inhibit conversation."
09/27/2013,Joey,5.0,This was our second time visiting and it was just as good as our 1st trip. I recommend anyone who enjoys a great steak to try it out
09/26/2013,Jay5,2.0,"I had high hopes for a steakhouse named after a legend, but this steakhouse was a huge let down. The service and ambience were splendid, the steak on the other hand not so much. The steak was not cooked evenly, and tasted bland. The sides were acceptable, but weren't spectacular. Would I visit again? Not likely!"
09/24/2013,Live2eat,5.0,"We celebrated my boyfriends 40th bday at the restaurant! I have to say from the time we walked in, the staff was very attentive but not over bearing!!! This was actually our 2nd visit, the food was excellent and we will definitely be back! If I had to make an improvement it would be something as simple as better candles for more light."
09/23/2013,Gcorigliano,5.0,Thanks for helping us enjoy our 5 year anniversary! Rob our waiter was awesome along with everyone there!! Great staff!! Thanks again!
09/22/2013,CesarSalad,3.0,The food this time was not as good as it usually is. The Caesar salad was awful. The steak was good. The baked Alaska was not good. The service was excellent.

09/13/2013,Johnsreview,5.0,"Cooked to perfection! Mouth watering filet! Medium rare was actually spot on!!

We took the dessert home (too full from main course) and it was great!"
09/12/2013,CATLADY,3.0,"For the price I paid I could have gone to a 5 star resort!
Instead, the CASINO???? Yuk, don't think I would go
Back to Michael Jordan Steak House at Mohegan Sun"
09/08/2013,DanP,3.0,"Came here for sons 21st birthday. Noted this when made reservation, but they completely missed it, so there was no acknowledgement about it whatsoever. (he was actually happy about that..) The food was very good, but I found the overall experience lacking. At $56.00 for a steak, the expectations are justifiably high. We didnt even have salt and pepper shakers at the table. The service was spotty and always off timed, although the waiter was very cordial and engaging. We went on a Sunday night, and it wasnt really busy, so that made the weak service even worse. In the future I will return to Flemings or JGilberts for the family celebration dinners."
09/08/2013,Suzanne,4.0,Service was terrible...our waiter and waiters around us were awful. Left us for long periods of time without checking to see if our food came or if we wanted a drink. The only attentive person was the gentlemen who brought the water and bread.
09/07/2013,PamK,4.0,"Excellent for diner before a night out in the casino. Do not skip the seafood tree, amazing selection, always fresh !"
09/07/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We had a large group to celebrate my husband's birthday, and the service was wonderful. The food was amazing. My husband and I split the porterhouse for two - so worth it! We had the tuna tartar for an appetizer that was the best I've ever had. I'm not a mashed potatoes person but the lobster mashed were so yummy. The meal ended with a nice birthday dessert for my husband that we all shared. I would definitely go back next time we are at the casino."
09/07/2013,joenicole,5.0,fabulous...steak was out of this world...cant wait to go back
09/05/2013,Jason,5.0,"Everytime I come here, I always have a GREAT experience. This time was the same treatment. Me and my wife were celebrating our 15 year anniversary. I had flowers delivered and they were already on my table waiting. The hostess put us in a great private booth along the wall. And Randy, our waiter, gave top notch service and attention. He also provided us with free champagne and desert for our big night. Just an amazing time at my favorite restaraunt. NEVER have had a bad meal or service there and I always come there when I come to Mohegan Sun."
09/03/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Excellent quality food, cooked to perfection. Personable, attentive but non- intrusive wait staff went ""the extra mile"" to accommodate a request for an off menu item. Will certainly dine here again."
09/01/2013,cooldosa,2.0,"Make sure you request for a high chair when you are making a reservation. Even I did requested it, they didn't have one when we were there. Had to wait around 20 minutes to get one. They told me they just have two high chairs. Steaks are fine but not exceptionally great. The serving staff were very friendly and professional."
08/31/2013,stevie,3.0,"The food was excellent; much better that past experiences ay MJs. Cold seafood platter was good and the Crab Cake was awesome. Delmonico steak was cooked to perfection and tasted great.
Downside is you can't talk to the people at your table because of the noise level and there was long delays between courses. Our meal took 2.5 hours which was way too long. The waitress was very nice and perhaps didn't see we were getting antsy."
08/31/2013,GeeTee,5.0,4th time...always extraordinary
08/31/2013,Fabulous,2.0,Food was ordinary to terrible. My husband said it was the worse steak he has ever eaten.
08/31/2013,AceAuto,4.0,Good food didn't have 1lb potatoes
08/31/2013,Jupiter,5.0,"We are return customers. Tried the Porterhouse steak for 2 ! Best steak ever out ! Plenty for 2. Still drooling thinking about it 2 days later. Love the beet salad and Asparagus cooked perfectly. And of course the garlic bread a must!! Their booths are nice atmosphere for celebrating an anniversary . Service has always been top notch. Open table reservation worked great, and we were seated immediately . Definitely recommend for special night out. Plain on spending $150-$250 for 2 depending on drinking habits."
08/30/2013,Luval22,5.0,"Not the steak, but everything else was done very well. We were late for our reservation and had to make a show in about an hour. They were able to still accomodate us without rushing us through dinner. On top of that the steak as always was great."
08/30/2013,Czeity,5.0,"This was a great place for a much needed night out! The filet and lobster mashed potatoes were phenomenal! They seated us in a booth which I found very nice and comfy! By the time we ordered wine and our dinners, we were left with a bill over $200 so... Bring your wallet! We did expect this and heard the food would not disappoint, and it did not! We since recommended it to friends and they all had the same wonderful experience! We will be back!"
08/30/2013,Corvette,4.0,Have been to this Michael Jordan's at Mohegan Sun on several occasions & have always been pleased. The food is top notch. The steak tartar appetizer is the BEST & the Baked Alaska is the one to get for dessert !
08/25/2013,Gandalf,3.0,The food and wine quality was excellent. The quality was somewhat marred by us being hassled to finish our appetiser so that our main course could be delivered. We were in a meaningful conversation and that pressure was not helpful or appreciated.
08/25/2013,knittingmaven1,4.0,always consistently good food and service
08/24/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The food was exceptional, as was the service. I wish there were fewer tables. We were right in the middle of two other couples. We ended up talking to them quite a bit through dinner because we were so close it would have been rude not to. Lovely people; however we were there to be together as a couple."
08/24/2013,Susan,5.0,"This restaurant is one of the best I've ever been to. The food is amazing! The lobster mashed potatoes were so delicious I wish I could eat them every day! The steak was great, as was everything.

I do have to mention regarding the reservation made through you guys - they did not have us on their reservation list even though we registered through Open Table. That was a little embarrassing."
08/24/2013,Two4Tea,4.0,"My wife cut her mouth on a chipped cocktail glass. The restaurant comped her meal (right thing to do) however, the they charged us for the replacement cocktail (charged for two even though the first was undrinkable). Also, we weren't interested in dessert but were told it would ""be free so we should get it."" While it was good, I thought it was weird, and maybe it was another opportunity to charge the meal to the bill to increase the total so the waiter could earn a bigger tip pre-discount? Either way, service was good, attentive and maitre'd was very sorry for the glass issue...it was clearly unintentional and we will go again when we're in the area. They did the right thing."
08/23/2013,Laymbo,4.0,"We have been there a few times because the food is excellent. The food was excellent again this time but we were not happy with the service. Our waitress was not friendly at all, in fact she was kind of cold. As she was taking our order, she was looking at something or someone else in the restaurant which probably explains why she forgot to bring out the salad that I ordered. She knew it was my husband's birthday, never asked if we wanted the ""free"" piece of cake they offer, she just gave us the dessert menu. These things may sound petty & I would not even mention them if the waitress was nice & friendly. We are not looking for someone to bend over backwards for us but just a shred of personality would be nice."
08/23/2013,JennyLynn,4.0,"This restaurant has great food and the service is very good. My steak was cooked slightly under and it was promptly taken back and fixed immediately. The food is delicious and there is a great beer, wine, cocktail list. My only issue is with the attire some people wear to the restaurant. This is classified online as fine dining and yet there were teenagers wearing short shorts and others wearing inappropriate clothing. If I'm paying $50 for a steak, I'd like to not be surrounded by people inappropriately dressed. I'm not saying suits and dresses, nice jeans and a shirt is fine."
08/21/2013,JuneK,5.0,We have dinned here several times and once or twice have tried other restaurants which were good but always go back to Michael Jordan's as everything there is excellent. We always highly recommend this restaurant.
08/20/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The food was great. I asked about the crab cake to our waitress jennifer and she said it was the best she ever tasted. She was right. It was perfect. Been to the best restaurants in NY and I'm adding this one to my list. You should open one in NY. Thanks for the great food and time!

08/19/2013,Holly,5.0,Enjoyed a fantastic meal. Service was incredible.
08/18/2013,Marioluvssteak,5.0,"Absolutely fantastic. The service is fantastic, the food is just flat out incredible. Started with garlic bread with blue cheese fondue, filet with lump crabmeat and a bernaisse sauce along with a lobster tail. My friend has his filet with a black truffle Parmesan crust which was amazing. Also had lobster mashed potatoes, cream spinach, and grilled corn off the cob. Was truly an amazing dinner. Party of 4 with everyone eating steak with a lobster tail, we shared 4 sides and had 2 appetizers and a couple drinks for only 322 dollars before tip. Couldn't recommend this restuarant any higher. Amazing, fantastic, second to none. Can't wait to go again and again"
08/17/2013,Cfaka,5.0,"The food and service is unbelievable, great treat! Perfect place to go for special occasion - we go every year for valentines day and anniversary! its a great dinner and then you can add some casino fun after."
08/17/2013,FromPA,5.0,"Service was impeccable. Appetizer and salad were unique. But the main event was the steaks! My husband, a meat and potatoes kind of guy in his mid-fifties (so he's had a few steaks in his life!) said his steak was the best he ever remembered having!"
08/17/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We were going to a concert at Mohegan Sun in CT and wanted to have dinner prior to the event. We made reservations at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse expecting the usual steakhouse food. What a wonderful surprise. A great watermelon, tomato and feta salad - so fresh and delicious as was the entire meal. An outstanding choice of wines. The service was outstanding."
08/17/2013,MJBerry,5.0,"We've eaten hear many times when at Mohegan Sun Casino. It is always delicious food and excellent service. I particularly like the crab cake - no filler. Ceasar salad and beet salad are both very good. The filet mignon is excellent. They just changed the fries from truffle to garlic. We didn't bother, because the truffle fries can't be beat. We got the sautéed mushrooms and onions. Great wine selections. We'll be back!"
08/15/2013,Foodluver,5.0,"We went here for our anniversary, the food was amazing! The steaks melted in your mouth and the potato purée was so flavorful. I personally do not like Caesar salad usually but the dressing was so light on this one that I actually enjoyed it. The prices are higher but definitely worth the quality and quantities of food you receive,"
08/13/2013,Melissa,2.0,"We picked Michael Jordan's because my husband & I wanted a special night out. The food was not that great and way over priced for what we got. We ordered salads which were so small. We thought the fries would be chunky thick steak fries since it is a steak restaurant after all, but they were just super greasy & salty. The asparagus was all rubbery and watery. The best thing was the steak, which was fabulous. Other than that, we won't be returning. Also, the other high end restaurants at Mohegan Sun usually send the manager over at some point to say hello and ask if everything is ok. Here, someone looking like a manager was walking around all night, but never stopped once to check in with us. We spend over $200 for a meal that was just ok."
08/11/2013,Scoopamarie,5.0,"Excellent service, excellent food."
08/11/2013,LindaG,4.0,"Everything was amazing with one exception, our server spoke so fast that we had her repeat everything she said twice."
08/11/2013,DiningFool,2.0,Food very tasty. Service fair and price expensive. Would not dine here again.

08/10/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Food was great, Service was good BUT.There was 6 of us who hadn't seen each other for months looking forward to a nice dinner and socializing, Noise level was so high could hardly converse with each other. Waitress even had to give us specials on each side of the table since we couldn't hear her. That was disappointing for the high end restaurant that this is that we couldn't hear each other. We also felt music played was not associated to the type of place, it was very loud as well."
08/10/2013,Wiseguy6768,4.0,"Great food, service and atmosphere. A bit expensive for regular dining, but expected from it's location inside the casino. One of the best bone-in ribeye steaks I have ever had."
08/03/2013,Frankie,5.0,"My boyfriend and I had dinner here this past weekend and it was fabulous. The service was great, the food was amazing and the wine and drink choices were out of this world. We loved our wait staff and the food was brought out quickly, it was prepared just right and overall it was the best meal we ever had."
07/29/2013,Jay1016,3.0,"My girlfriend and I went to Michael Jordan's Steakhouse the other night and I have to say I was very disappointed. With high prices I expect high quality. Service was not great, took almost 10 minutes to get each drink we ordered, waitress was ok but not great and she has a runner bringing out her food. Macaroni and cheese is very good, steak was very overcooked, dry, and just overall not a great tasting steak for $40 with no sides. As it was a Monday night and fairly slow this is a very poor first experience and I am not sure if we will attend again."
07/28/2013,OTLongTimeMember,2.0,"The decor screams Bonanza. My steak was over cooked and dry. The side was ignored and when I mentioned to the overworked server it finally arrived as I was on my last bite. The side, garlic and rosemary fries, was a mess - thin shavings of potatoes that had to be gently picked up with fingers lest they crumble. $39 for my filet and another $3 for bad bernaise sauce, $42 for lamb chops ( my wife said they were excellent) but no sides included and no sense of presentation. The tables are packed making the place very noisy. Dining is pretty dismal at all of the fine dining restaurants here and has been on the decline. Poor service, tightly packed tables (sans table clothes), high noise levels, and the celebrity seems to not be involved."
07/28/2013,Piasony,5.0,"Couldn't have asked for
A better dinner ! I love this place only am sad the tuna tartar is no longer on the menu:("
07/27/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"MICHAEL JORDAN'S STEAKOUSE SERVES EXCELLENT QUALITY OF FOOD. THE SERVICE IS OUTSTANDING AS WELL. MY ONLY REASON FOR STATING IT IS GOOD FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS IS THAT THE MEALS ARE A LITTLE PRICEY. THE ITEM CHOICES ARE APPROPRIATE FOR A STEAKHOUSEM ALONG WITH SOME UNIQUE STEAKS, SIDES DISHES AS WELL AS APPETIZERS. WISH I WAS RICH SO I COULD GO ONCE A WEEK! LOL"
07/25/2013,Jerseygirl,5.0,The service and the food at this establishment were excellent. I would definitely dine here again and highly recommend it to others.
07/24/2013,Ilovesteak,5.0,"My fiancé and I went there for our anniversary dinner and it was delicious! I got the filet and it was the best I've ever had in my life! It was so tender, I could have used a butter knife to cut it. My fiancé said the same thing about his New York strip. I also got a sangria which was amazing and we had the maple bacon and the garlic bread for appetizers and those were to die for as well."
07/24/2013,blinggirl,4.0,Need to bring back the Kanas City Strip and offer more steaks. The menu has gotten smaller since our last visit. Variety is always better.
07/22/2013,savorysweetlife12,4.0,I was recently dined at Jordan's and another great experience. The food was delicious and service excellent.

07/19/2013,JohnW,4.0,"My wife and I arrived early for a 5:00 dinner reservation, so we told the hostess we would have a drink at the bar. The bartenders were so friendly and helpful (and told us that both the bar and regular menus were available there) that we elected to stay at the bar for dinner. We decided not to overdo it with sides and went with Steak House burgers (a combination of Angus beef, short rib, and brisket) and truffle fries. Only burgers and fries, but all was delicious. The burger also comes with a free beer of your choice. It was a very good dinner and, with drinks and tip, was only about $100.00 for two; reasonable for any steakhouse. But for the fact that it is located inside the casino and 1 1/2 hours from home, I would be a regular."
07/18/2013,Robin,3.0,"It took 40 minutes to be seated from the time of our reservations. We had tickets to an event that night and missed the first 15 minutes. The staff was very apologetic for all the delays and the overbooking was not their fault. We left before our entries came, which was unfortunate because the appetizers were spectacular. It is mind boggling how an established restaurant could not have been prepared on such a night! Other than all the confusion around timing I would gladly go back, the staff did the best they could under the conditions they were handed and the wine and food exceptional."
07/18/2013,TTlovesCARMINES,2.0,"Was tremendously dissapointed in all aspects... Have dined here many times, and this was, by far our worst experience!"
07/16/2013,Foodiegrl,5.0,Michael Jordan's steakhouse is on the top of my list of favorite restaurants. The Mohegan Sun casino location is awesome. Tried the NYC grande central location twice and it was very disappointing each time. The garlic bread appetizer is out of this world. I usually get a steak when I'm there. Well worth the price for a nice night out or special occasion.
07/14/2013,Susan4,5.0,"Not only was Jordon the best basketball player on the planet, he also knows how to dish up some great food. I know when I am heading to Mohegan Sun we are dining at Michael Jordan's steak house. The service and food are always terrific and you will never go away hungry. Check it out on your next visit."

07/13/2013,HWD3,4.0,The Kobe steak was over sold. The filet was just as tasty and more tender. Steak for two was very good as were the sides.
07/13/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Great food, but a bit more expensive than I anticipated relative to similar restaurants."
07/12/2013,fivestar,5.0,"Food was outstanding! Had the petite Filet with the Surf Option (Add Lobster tail), and highly recommend it. the service was great, everyone was very friendly and helpful. It was a bit noisy, and was hard to hear the person next you talking. Nothing much about the restaurant decor stands out. Not sure what it has to do with Michael Jordan other than having is name on the door. It was very pricey, but I knew that going in, but even still; was a bit surprised by the check."
07/09/2013,pacmangolf,5.0,"GREAT NIGHT from start to finish. Robert our server paced our meal very well. Birthday dinner for my wife with my daughter. Started the night with the beet salad which was very good, Dinners were Fillet medium rare, free range chicken served with vegetables done just right and last but not least lobster bisque and crab cake. Everything tasted great. THEN we got a very nice surprise when Robert returned to our table with a crème brulee that had a candle in the center and three glasses of champagne to kick off the birthday celebration...A very nice touch that made my wife' night, thanks...OUTSTANDING night"
07/07/2013,Travelbabe,4.0,"I spent the July 4th weekend a nearby inn but as always I choose to dine for special occasions at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse when I am in the area.

The food was very good (lump crab cake), salads, oysters as well as the wine.

Service this evening however was spotty. I had to ask the bus boy to track down my waitress so that I cold pay the bill and leave. There were three servers at least that brought my dinner but not sure why. Also, when I was seated,
I was told my waiter would be one person but another person showed and she was all over the place.
I certainly hope that this was a one-off situation. Otherwise food and ambiance were great.

A good steak and glasses of wine at rather high prices."

Our waitress was pleasant and knowledgeable All ot her choices were right on .She probably could have reccommended anything and been right.
I requested a special cut of beef and our waitress returned with the Chef who was holding a tray with three steaks to choose from. It was a nice touch as I have been a meat utter for forty nine years.
MJ,s Steakhouse could only be better if Michael had been there himself"
07/04/2013,Curly,5.0,"We went to celebrate our anniversary.
The food was excellent and served in a timely manner.

and then a small chocolate treat for dessert which was also complementary.
It was a lovely evening and very enjoyable."
07/01/2013,RobS,5.0,"There's never a doubt that you will get a great steak at MJ's. When we want to be sure to have a great steak - especially when with clients, we've never been disappointed at Michael Jordan's and highly recommend it."
07/01/2013,ThomasP,5.0,"Michael Jordan was the best when it came to basketball, but he scores big with me because of his restaurant. It has remained the one steakhouse that over the years has continually delivered the best quality time after time whenever we have visited. The steak is always perfect, cooked as requested, tender and delicious. The sides are great. The food is delivered HOT; an important attribute IMO. The bread to start off tastes good. Bread that tastes good to start off your dining experience is important to me. The service is always top notch. Other top name restaurants have disappointed, but not MJ's. Keep up the great work. I look forward to my next visit."

you are greeted with perfect hostess accumenand shown to your table. The ambience is vibrant but the tables are far enough apart to have a private conversation. Wine list is extensive and many great wines are avaialble by the glass. We had a new Sauvignon Blanc that was one of the best we had had. We ordered the crab cake appetizer. It came quickly and was a tower of lump crab meat perfectly done with a hint of crust at the top. It was the best crab cake we ever tasted. I ordered the Kansas City Ribeye, the highest priced steak on the menu at 45.00. The steak was perfect as usual. My wife had Ahi Tuna.Awesome!"
06/22/2013,Kelle,5.0,Had dinner before a show- really excellent service and a great meal. Will definitely go back.
06/22/2013,TFresh1960,5.0,Excellent experience!! Classy place! Highly recommend!
06/22/2013,KPK21,5.0,MJ's excels at service. Food is always great.
06/15/2013,PaulA,4.0,"My wife's 50th birthday so I treated her to a tip to Mohegan Sun for a show, gambling and a good meal. The steaks and sides were prepared exactly as ordered and were delicious. The service was outstanding. The restaurant itself was a convenient distance from the hotel, the casino and the shops.

My only complaint was the noise level in the restaurant which required you to raise your voice a bit to be heard."
06/15/2013,Mjc019cop,5.0,Third time eating here this month and as always MJs is on the top if my favorites list. The food is prepped to perfection and the service is premier. I order the Kansas City Strip and it is a great value for the money. Don't leave without having the choc lava cake for desert you will not be disappointed.
06/14/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Food was great. Trying to have a quiet anniversary dinner but a loud group was seated next to us which became very distracting.
06/13/2013,John,5.0,My wife and I had nice dinner on Wednesday night. Food was very good. The servers were very good. Wine list is very pricey. It would be nice to have more affordable wines.
06/12/2013,Rachel,5.0,"I took my boyfriend here for his Birthday Dinner, and we were VERY satisfied with the whole experience. The food was Phenomenal and our waitress was great!!! I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant, you won't be disappointed!"
06/11/2013,dpaige11,3.0,I was on a business trip in the area. None of my coworkers had been to a Micheal Jordan Resturant. I had in NY. So we decided to give it a shot. Nice experiences and def a good place for a work dinner with coworkers. staff was nice and always checked on us if we needed anything. Would def go again.
06/09/2013,steaklover,5.0,"everything was great, as it always is!"
06/08/2013,Markonskis,5.0,We've been to Mohegan Sun several times and have also wanted to get in to MJ's restaurant but always packed. This time we made a reservation which was thankfully confirmed multiple times and had an excellent time with our group. We arrived a little early but our table was ready within minutes. The staff was super...just perfect in knowing when we needed something and when were perfectly fine enjoying ourselves. The wine was great and the food was over the top in every way. The porter house for two was exceptional. The skirt steak was tasty and the filet and lobster tail were done to perfection. Definitely a foodies place with the abundance of flavors going on. We're already looking forward to our next visit.
06/08/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food and service were fantastic. Everything was perfect couldn't ask for anything better!
06/08/2013,Mjc019cop,5.0,"I am a regular here and the service and food is always consistent. I highly recommend this restaurant. Steaks are always cooked to perfection, the side dishes are all great choices but the lobster mac n cheese is out of this world. For desert the choc lava cake is fantastic."
06/08/2013,Chris,5.0,"Always Outstanding, never had a bad meal...however, would like to see a better selection of salad choice."
06/08/2013,SANVR,5.0,"Only our 2nd time here, it's fast becoming our "" special day "" pick. We had a booth which besides elevating the romantic feel allowed the conversation to be easily heard, despite the full house. The food was great and the service equally impressive; sincere, knowledgable and attentive - there when you need them yet invisible till then."
06/07/2013,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"The high prices are commensurate to high-end steak restaurants. However, the steaks (a filet mignon, and a bone-in filet) were mediocre at best. The salads and sides were fair, nothing special. The ambience is awful; loud (music and TV's blaring), very casual (t-shirts and shorts in abundance), and the servers were meh. The restaurant was almost empty, but we were seated next to the servers' station (they stood around chatting). Another couple came in and were seated at a table inches away from us, even though there were dozens of empty tables. The restaurant has more of a sports bar atmosphere, though too expensive to be called such. I love a good steak restaurant, but we won't go back to Michaels Jordan's. Disappointing."
06/06/2013,Mjc019cop,5.0,One of my favorite restaurants. I have eaten here 2-3 times in one week. The food and service is consistent and of best quality. You really get what you pay for.
06/01/2013,tysons,5.0,"Everything was great. My wife had the tuna which was a very good portion. I had the steak special which was the best steak I ever had. Jess, our server was outstanding and service overall was very good. Thanks for making our anniversary dinner memorable one."
06/01/2013,Sallysue,5.0,"Great place our food was outstanding, will definitely be back:)"
05/30/2013,josephmpalladino,5.0,We always enjoy coming to MJ to clebrate a special occasion.
05/27/2013,tlc123,2.0,"I felt it was extremely overpriced for the steaks. 48.00 for a very small strip steak....not good. This was my fourth visit there and I felt like the portions have decreased, yet the price is the same."
05/26/2013,LarryG,3.0,"We had the stake special of the day, a bone in fillet and it was outstanding. The service was good but the noise was a little too loud for our taste. Overall I would difinatly recommend the resturant."
05/26/2013,afell,5.0,"food was awesome, couple next to us was completely OBNOXIOUS. obviously not the restaurants fault - but it was a complete turn off.. especially considering the occasion was for my boyfriends birthday and we had to listen to someone whine about ""the service"" because a official waiter didn't come over to take their order within the first 90 seconds of them sitting down. terrible. request booths, or specific seating.

food was awesome.. had Geoff as a server who was knowledgeable and really helpful. gave us a lot of privacy but didn't write us off when it came time to order or needed something. get the hot chocolate cake."
05/25/2013,NLev,5.0,We went to Jordan's for our anniversary. Jordan's is the best place for a special occasion. The food is up there with the best food you'll find anywhere. Always an amazing dinner.
05/25/2013,Graybarn41,5.0,"Had the shared Porterhouse. First time, steak came out more than medium rare. Server gladly took the steak back, the next one was perfect! Fantastic!"
05/19/2013,KIMG471,5.0,i HAD THE FILET AND IT WAS THE BEST STEAK I'VE EVER HAD. VERY TASTY.
05/18/2013,carmenc,3.0,"The decor was a dark rustic look. Brown shades of color. It had a real manly look. The lighting was dim for a romantic feel. Chairs were leather high backs but tables were cheap restaurant tables. They didn't match.
The crab cake, and cheesy bread were great. There was a bacon appetizer for $12 dollars that we ordered because I just had to see it. It was two piece of country bacon glazed with a syrup. I just found it to be hysterical .
Drinks were great . My entree was the delmontico steak which was a little dry. Our sides were mashed potatoe with lobster and mac and cheese with lobster. They were good. My friend ordered the lamb which she said was a little dry. We had no room for dessert
Service was excellent. My party had a great time"
05/12/2013,Brooke,5.0,"The only complaint I have is about the temperature in the restaurant. It was very very cold. Other than that the food was excellent, the service was outstanding, and I will definitely go back!"
05/12/2013,Loveexperiences,5.0,It was my sons 6th birthday and Mother's Day so he wanted to go here. The food is very expensive but worth it once a year. It was nice to bring my son a cake. My kids love the pillows behind you at the tables.
05/10/2013,DavidS,4.0,"This place gets em in and gets em out. A well oiled machine with a great kitchen. I really enjoyed the food. The chef adds little twists to the traditional steak house menu to make it interesting and delicious. We split the beet salad which was wonderful and the garlic toast with blue cheese fondue. I had the filet and my partner had the scallops. Both perfect and we really enjoyed the french fries with truffle oil.
All in all a great experience"
05/10/2013,Marley,3.0,Shrimp cocktail. $4 per shrimp that were small by shrimp cocktail standards The filet was good to very good. The chocolate cake (a specialty) was dry. The espresso was good.
05/05/2013,Fatandhappy,5.0,"This was our first visit and we went here to celebrate our anniversary and requested a quiet table. When we first arrived we were concerned that there was no way to enjoy a meal with the noise level what it was, however when we were shown to our table it was at the very back of the restaurant. It was the perfect spot to have a quiet and romantic dinner to celebrate.

The server Kerri was very helpful with our choices, and the staff obviously took the effort to make it a special evening by granting our special request. Every course was superb and well worth the prices. When our dessert arrived we were pleasantly surprised with a candle in the 23 layer cake and 2 glasses of champagne. Very happy with the experience."
05/04/2013,eddrotman,1.0,"Most important item is the food, and the steaks were not at all flavorfull."
05/04/2013,kmoose,2.0,New it was expensive going in but for the prices I expected a more refined dining experience. So noisy that you could not carry on a conversation with the person next to you.
05/04/2013,HenryB,3.0,kc strip steak was disappointing. service excellent. also insufficient silverware on table when we arrived.
04/29/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Food was amazing ,atmosphere was great and the staff are so friendly."
04/28/2013,Keisha,3.0,"Ovetall the restaurant was good.this was our second visit.and i will say thst it was not as good as the first visit..
We were well aware that the restaurant was pricy and that was fine with us however the ultimate insult was bring charged for ice for a top shelf vodka. Are you kidding.
wont be background"
04/28/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We love dining at Michael Jordan's restaurant. The food is so good and the staff is incredible.
04/27/2013,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Our family has celebrated many special events at Michael Jordan's and have always been very pleased but not his time. The steak was ok at best
And that is not what we have grown to expect at this restaurant. It will be a long time before we will be back! Disappointing!"
04/27/2013,Annpop,4.0,They try to take your plate away before you put your fork down...twice we had to tell them we were not finished...
04/27/2013,JoeU,5.0,"Have eaten at the place numerous times. Have not been disappointed with service or food quality. Its been great. Servers are excellent, and they take time to find out your interests. I forsee numerous times coming to eat at MJ's again."
04/27/2013,Elway,5.0,"A phenomenal Porterhouse for two, done to perfection! Don't miss the ""tower"" of garlic bread for an appetizer. Yes, it may be pricey, BUT, it is worth every cent & more. One of our favorite steak houses!"
04/27/2013,KathyH,5.0,The food and service are always outstanding. The steaks never disappoint and while it is pricey the amount of food you get is plentiful. The sides can be shared with another and sometimes a third. You would be making a huge mistake to not start your meal with the garlic bread. While it's not on the menu for two people you can get a half order which is plenty for those who just want a taste while looking over the menu.
04/23/2013,HamiltonWinner,5.0,"We had a wonderful meal, the staff was terrific and we truly enjoyed everything."
04/21/2013,GSD53,4.0,"We had the NY strip and the filet mignon with creamed spinach and sauteed mushrooms and onions which was all delicious. I would recommend they drop the cheese fondue dipping sauce with the garlic bread. Totally not necessary, the bread is great on its own."
04/20/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Garlic Bread appeitzer was superb. Steak was cooked to perfection. Service was excellent. It was pricing but we expected that but the quality was outstanding.
04/20/2013,Cathy,4.0,"The food was prepared nicely. One thing to note, is I got my husband medium cooked steak he got my medium rare. We could not swap plates because they were ordered with different add ons. We had concert tickets and had little extra time so we enjoyed what we received. It was cooked to perfection. Will return!!! Loved it!"
04/20/2013,Love2Eat,5.0,The food was awesome! I only gave the ambiance a 4 because it kind of presented itself as a quiet romantic place (which we were looking for) but it was actually more like a loud bar scene. I still love the food and loved the place and can't wait to go back!!
04/19/2013,FNA11,3.0,"Prices in this restaurant are not in line with market and food quality. It is extremely expensive for what it has to offer. This is in comparison to other steak places like the capital grill, Ruth Chris and flemmings. This place can do a lot better by offering Fresh and not aged meat and reduce prices by 20 - 30%. In addition, if it mean to be upscale restaurant, get rid and replace all the chairs and tables, especially tables. They make you feel you are sitting in fast food diner."
04/19/2013,APlante,4.0,"The food was excellent, but honestly everything was a little too salty. Great service also."
04/19/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The food and service are always very good at Michael Jordan's dining room.
The Ionly negative would be when there is a big show the crowd and noise are excessive. Planning ahead is wise."
04/17/2013,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Have had dinner here multiple times over the last 3 years and the consistency is just not there.The last 2 times my Filet was over cooked, and although the sous-chef came out to tell me they would fix it and they did, in under 5 minutes, it was basically undercooked the second time around. (ordered MR delivered MW, second time out R) If your a steakhouse, you should be able to cook steak! The arugala salad was very good, as was the tuna tartar. The sides of sauteed spinach and mushrooms were good.
Service was ok but to wait 15 minutes for our initial cocktail order was really not acceptable. Our server seemed to have plenty of time to be chatting it up with the fellow co-workers while at the computer, while we continued to wait for drink"
04/16/2013,Cruiser911,4.0,"The bone in rib eye was very flavorful and seasoned just right. For the price, it was small but I left the restaurant satisfied."
04/16/2013,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"Mrs had steak I had the ""lamb special"" - the worst two pieces of meat ever -
steak was tough/chewy - lamb ""3 small chops"" over coucous (heavy with lemon)
could not finish it - lamp was extremely fatty and tough to chew - filled up
on rolls - we never have bread with our meals - expressed our displeasure to
server he apologized and handed us a bill of $102.00 - no drinks no dessert -
We looked so forward to this dinner and so upset with the meal we cut our
stay & left next morning - I realize the bill was taken care of via comp.
points - but it takes a lot of playing to get these points -
I guess if we ever go back we'll stick with the buffet -"
04/14/2013,WilliamM,3.0,"Michael Jordans is split into sections. There is the sports bar, a ""Mid"" section and what appeared to be a very nice dining area. Unfortunately we were put in the ""mid"" section(what we referred to as the ""commoners"" area). It was very loud. We had to basically yell to talk to each other.....the drinks were expensive and not strong at all....for that price you, a martini should at least have a bit of a kick.
We had friends in from out of town and wanted someplace special for dinner but unfortunately it did not work out here...."
04/13/2013,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Very loud restaurant. Food was good. Service
was friendly."
04/13/2013,KevinC,4.0,"Excellent food -- from tuna appetizer to steak main and lobster mash side, everything was delicious. The staff asked if we were celebrating anything and, over my girlfriend's objections, I told them we were celebrating her birthday. After dinner, without a great deal of unnecessary fanfare, our waitress arrived with a small cake with a birthday candle; a very nice touch."
04/13/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,I went to MJs steakhouse with reservations for 4 at 6pm on a Saturday. We were able to get in before our reservation time because the restaurant was not too busy. We were promptly greeted. Everything we ordered came in a timely manner. While we were there the restaurant became quite busy but service was not sacrificed because of it. Everyone in my party agreed that the food was excellent. My only complaint is the 1.5 lb lobster that I received had a very hard shell which made it difficult to eat. My husband had to crack the shell for me aftet i struggled with it for quite awhile. i had expected that the lobster would be more deshelled than it was.
04/13/2013,DebD,5.0,"We were quickly seated upon arriving. Very busy and a bit noisy! Waitress was friendly helpful and attentive up until dinner arrived & then never checked on us to see how everything was. Fortunately, everything was absolutely delicious. We started with martini's that were exceptional, the stuffed blue cheese olives, were fab!! Ordered the garlic bread which was as good as I heard it would be. I had the tuna tartar appetizer(excellent), hubby had the oysters and said he should have ordered more! We had the Porterhouse steak for two, it was cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth; lobster mashed pototo's (yum); roasted asparagus a bit too salty. For dessert we ordered the Baked Alaska, very,delish & finished with black coffee, 5*'s"
04/09/2013,Elizabeth,5.0,"Had an amazing time, great service, loved the dinner, and the private seating arrangements. Overall noteworthy."
04/06/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The quality of the meal and the service were great. Both the steak and lobster were cooked perfectly. I have been to the restaurant many times, and know it's not a quiet dining experience. I find the noise level to be excessive--- the music is a little too loud, and larger groups sitting near a table of two is not the best setup. It's definitely hard to carry on a conversation in a normal voice. That being said, the food more than made up for the noise factor, but it does make me consider other restaurants first when I want a more calm and relaxed evening."
04/06/2013,TrudyC,5.0,"The food is fabulous, but it is very expensive. I wish they had smaller steaks on the menu, since a 20oz is seriously over the top (and that is one of the smaller options)."
04/05/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Food was excellent. Loud atmosphere.
04/05/2013,SaMo,5.0,"Excellent food and service, just very expensive since everything is ala carte."
03/31/2013,lovingfood,4.0,Food is excellent. The aged steaks just melt in your mouth. The crab cakes are fantastic.
03/31/2013,MarcoK,4.0,"Always a more civilized bit of dining at Mohegan.... Look, you are in a casino and it is the only casino for miles around. You are going to spend a decent chunk of change on dinner anyway regardless of which restaurant you choose. You might as well have a decent cut of meat and outstanding service. Our waitress was smart, beautiful and great at what she did. Is it cheap? NO. Is it the best steak you'll ever have? Probably not. Is it a great restaurant? Absolutely. Try the garlic bread and make sure to get your steaks butterflied."
03/31/2013,CatherineL,3.0,This is our second time at this restaurant for dinner.This time unlike our first we were not so comfortable and the food was not very good.We were five adults. Four tall men and one woman. We were crowded into a half circle booth though the restaurant was not especially full. One of the men had to sit akwardly on a corner of the table.The parmesan crusted skirt steat was not parmesean crusted. It was covered with a green garnish with two slices of shaved parmesean sitting cold on top of the garnish. The steak had no flavor of parmesean cheese at all.The lettuce wedge with blue cheese was not a wedge of iceberg lettuce but an amount of romain lettuce with most of the bitter white ends included in the plate.We decided not to return.
03/30/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,This was my first time dining at Michael Jordan's and I had a great experience! The food was incredible and the service was spot on. If you are looking for a fine dining experience this restaurant is it! I highly recommend the sea scallops for non steak dishes as well as the lobster mashed potatoes and grilled corn off the cob!
03/30/2013,StuartB,5.0,Always an enjoyable time. The garlic bread which we always order was a bit over done which seemed to be out of character.
03/29/2013,NicoleG,5.0,Excellent food and great service from Mike!
03/29/2013,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"Awful experience ! Over- priced for a loud restaurant with mediocre food. My medium steak was way over cooked and our waiter never checked on us.
Then instead of taking the steak off the bill we were given a 20 percent off coupon for another visit I have that coupon away!
We were seated in small area between two other couples. I would not recommend this restaurant !"
03/29/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Wonderful food and service. If you enjoy a good steak, this is the place!"
03/29/2013,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"I'm souring on MJ's managerial service. I'm a MJ's Reward Club card member & and that card is so hard to use. I've been to this MJ Steakhouse at least a dozen times... the food is great and worthy of 5 Stars... the atmosphere is busy and could have been designed as more intimate, so it's only a 3 or 4 Star place atmosphere-wise... I'm tiring of having great $100 plus wines and failing at the time the bill comes to remember to pull out my MJ's Club card. Major chains like CVS pharmacy, are at least smart enough to tie their cards to our names and telephone numbers. Why can't MJ's do the same? I spent $316 on Thursdays visit for 3 of us & forgot to present that card at time of payment. Blame it on a fine bottle of wine, I guess."
03/27/2013,Dave,3.0,Entree took an hour to get to table from the time we sat down.
03/27/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,MJ is a very good steakhouse but there are much better restaurants in CT where one can get a great steak outside of the casino. It was a bit too crowded for my liking but that is the nature of just about any popular casino restaurant.
03/27/2013,OpenTable Diner,3.0,great place for a bachelorette party.. Food was great and service was good... very accomodationg for a large party
03/24/2013,TanyaC,5.0,"We had a great time. Our server, I think it was Jeff, was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!! We tend to eat out 4-5 times a week where we live in the Lakes Region of New hampshire. We have not had service and or food the great anywhere up here. We were reccommended to your resturant by a couple that comes there 4-5 times a month. Thank you again for a great time!!!! Will reccommend to any and everyone we know!!!!"
03/23/2013,BonnieZ,4.0,"MEAL WAS GOOD, BUT NOT AS GOOD AS WE EXPECTED"
03/23/2013,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"This was a special occasion - my husband's birthday and night out for parents of a 1 and 3 year old before the Kenny Chesney concert. Unfortunately, my husband's steak was VERY over done. It was requested medium and came out very well done. For a steakhouse this is unacceptable. Also I asked for my filet medium and it was cooked perfectly which added insult to the situation. When we talked to our server about it, he then went to his manager who was willing to make up for it by giving us two beers on the house. An overcooked steak priced at $44 versus $12 beers - hardly a makegood."
03/23/2013,OpenTable Diner,1.0,My steak was burned my dessert was frozen will not be back
03/23/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Outstanding place to have dinner. I have a not had a better steak anywhere.
03/22/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,I have really enjoyed the restaurant. The kitkat bar dessert rocks and so does the crab cake best I have ever had anywhere in the world. The selections are adequate but they should have more specials. They specials like the ribeye and the short ribs are awesome. It provides there regulars with some variety where right now there is none unless its a holiday and that's only for a few days. I don't mean to tell them to alter their menu as it stands because its a great selection. Ohh and don't remove the kitkat bar again!!! Thanks henry
03/22/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,drinks were slow to come to table two times
03/22/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"wonderful dinner experience all around from the wine, food, and service. would definitely recommend. Baked Alaska for dessert was phenomenonal!"
03/20/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"A very nice dining experience. Service was prompt and efficient. Food presentation, and taste wonderful! Cost $$$ but worth the money and experience."
03/20/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,we had a very nice time. the service was great as well as the food.
03/16/2013,Jbone,4.0,"Had dinner on Saturday, March 16. Fabulous meal and great service. Hands down the best bone in ribeye I have ever had. Sides were tasty-the grilled corn was a fave at the table along with the fries and mac n cheese. Pricey yes but all great steakhouses are and this one ranks at the top for me."
03/16/2013,Barbara,2.0,I have been to Michael Jordan's a number of times and have always enjoyed it. This time was horrible ! My prime delmonico was so tough and over done I could hardly chew it. There was 7 of us and not one of us enjoyed our meal. I don't know if I will go back again. For the prices they charge it should be perfect !!
03/16/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Our night at MJs was fantastic as expected. Food , service and overall ambiance was perfect."
03/16/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Food was great. Service was lackluster. Actually sat for 30 minutes after the waitress dropped off the check waiting to pay. Food is always great though
03/15/2013,JackG,4.0,"Excellent food, nice atmosphere and service was very attentive"
03/15/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Food was great. Normal portions.service was experienced and very good. Dining was a little too cafeteria style for the price. Would have thought nothing of price with better more private atmosphere.
03/15/2013,drexelshow,5.0,"The garlic bread i mean just wow... i could not have imagened something so wonderful. i would go back just for that and that alone. My date ordered a cast iron paned bird with all the fixings and it looked wonderful. I ordered the scallops and they were great over the top great. i will deffinatly be back for more on special occasions, or just to sneak away for the garlic bread."
03/10/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,very expensive but the food was delicious.........had the Kansas city strip was great......my 18 dollar lobster tail was a bit small but very tasty
03/09/2013,Kjaern21,4.0,Great service and unique drink menu
03/09/2013,JimK,3.0,"Jordan's has been our ""go to"" Steakhouse because there isn't another great alternative in the area (CT Shoreline). It's usually quite good albeit expensive. This most recent trip was pretty average. First round of drinks was incorrect, and my Kansas City Strip was over cooked and coated in some sort of overpowering steak sauce. Noise level was on the high side as well. We'll go back, but we're a little cautious now. At these prices I expect a better experience."
03/08/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,The service was great. Very informative but the food was just so so. I didn't feel that the steaks were worth the cost and same with the wine choices. Not sure that I would go back again and pay those prices.
03/08/2013,Rktht,4.0,Great food but you pay for what you get. Pretty pricey.
03/03/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Food was fantastic! Very happy and will def return.
03/02/2013,MarieKee65,4.0,Have eaten there before. Food was delicious!! Very noisy when the restaurant and bar are full. Very nice atmosphere.
03/01/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"My husband and I save MJ's steakhouse for special occasions as it's pricey, but worth it. When we want fine dining to celebrate an anniversary or birthday, and we want a 5 star dining experience, it's the perfect place to go. The first time we ever went, I learned what having a good steak truly meant. On our most recent visit we loved the garlic bread and cheese....so good I was ready to say forget the steak! My husband had the Delmonico and I had the skirt steak; both were delicious. Our sides were the lobster mashed and sweet corn; they were the perfect addition to our meal. Service was well done."
02/28/2013,Jarhead,5.0,Michael Jordan's was outstanding. The steaks were cooked to perfection. The service was also great. Definitely would go back again
02/28/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Everything was very good and had a wonderful evening. Will go back for sure.
02/27/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"very good, consistent food and very good service. will be ack!"
02/26/2013,CherylC,5.0,Love this restaurant! Service is excellent and the food is outstanding. My only complaint is sometimes it is a little noisy in the front dining area because the tables seem closer together.
02/25/2013,FranA,5.0,"The food is always amazing. We always get steak since that's what they specialize in and it's always cooked to perfection! Even the fish dishes -- tuna tartare is amazing and the shrimp cocktail is done just right. The service is outstanding...they are all wonderful, young people who get to know you even though they are extremely busy. We go at least once a year for a special occasion, girl's getaway, and this is always the restaurant we return too. We own wine shops and bring our own special bottles and they just charge us a corkage fee (totally understandable). The other restaurants in Mohegan Sun will not allow this as we were looking at all the restaurants at one time. They will not disappoint!"
02/24/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We always enjoy dining at this restaurant. Great dining experience and service.
02/24/2013,ScottM,5.0,Great service and food! A must for serious carnivores!
02/23/2013,Ketoguy,4.0,"Very consistant and steady meal. They have a new seasoning for the steak, it is delicious but you might want to ask for it on the side. The sodium can be overwhelming. The macaroni and cheese remains my favorite side anywhere!!"
02/22/2013,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"For a steak house, I found the atmosphere too frenetic, loud and full of cigarette smoke.
It was difficult to carry on a quiet conversation due to the overall loud atmosphere.
The steak was good, primarily due to the sauce.
Very expensive, loud, smokey glorified Longhorn steakhouse"
02/22/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Food and service was phenomenal but I felt as though it was a little too dark in the booths
02/22/2013,Marcy,5.0,"The food and service are always outstanding! The garlic bread with blue cheese fondue is a must have! We split all of the following and everything was delicious: garlic bread, arugula salad, rib eye steak, lobster mashed potatoes, and creme brulee. Our server was excellent as well. Will definitely go back."
02/18/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We have a wonderful time! Everything was excellent!
02/17/2013,Louu,2.0,"The steaks were slightly over done and very spicy, seemed like they were trying to cover up the flavor of the steak. Mashed potatoes were bland. It was very loud, but that can't be helped. Overall not worth the price of the food."
02/17/2013,Mjc019cop,5.0,Always a favorite and consistent restaurant. Meals prepared to perfection and wait staff very attentive.
02/16/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Michael Jordan's Steakhouse continues to impress me beyond belief. It is always an orgiastic feast for my senses!
02/16/2013,AmyG,5.0,"Booked on Open Table and requested a booth, as we are familiar with the seating at this restaurant. We were asked upon check in if we minded a 15 minute wait for our requested seating and we did not mind at all. We found a seat at the bar and a handsome mixologist was our company for the next 15 minutes. He and my fiancée talked a bunch and before we knew it, our private booth was ready. As always , service was perfect, food was delicious and ambiance was perfect. Our meal consisted of the following: blue cheese garlic bread, beer salad, lobster bisque, filet with lobster tail and ny strip with lobster tail, corn off the cob and lobster mashed! Everything was served perfect to our liking and flavors were 5 star! We will return!!"
02/16/2013,Linda,5.0,Best steak for two! Cooked to perfection.
02/16/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Best steak I've ever had....would travel from Boston to CT to have another serving of their famous steaks....
02/16/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Service was excellent and we always love the lobster mash potatoes!
02/15/2013,KPK21,5.0,We go to MJ's atleast once a week........year round !!! What does that tell you about MJ's ?
02/15/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"excellent menu choices, and steaks that can stand on thier own."
02/14/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,I had been saving this restaurant for a special occasion. Service was very good. The atmosphere was pleasant but the tables were a little too close to have a private meal. The food was good but did not live up to expectations. The appetizer was a big disappointment. My wife's seafood was a little bland while my steak had too much fat and gristle for the price. Overall the experience was good but I doubt I would go again.
02/14/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Our servers were spot on, the wine list was fabulous, and the food was superb. We ordered the filet mignon and the Kansas strip steak with roasted asparagus and appetizer of shrimp cocktail. Presentation was simple yet elegant, the steaks cooked to perfection. A perfect Valentine's Day dinner... The last time I had been to Michael Jordan's here at Mohegan Sun was on the eve of my son's departure for deployment to Iraq with the First Cavalry. I think my son actually had TWO steaks... but I recall the same experience then. This tells me Michael Jordan's takes pride in consistently good service and food preparation. I will be back...."
02/02/2013,MJBerry,5.0,"MJ's Steakhouse is by FAR the best restaurant at the casino. They have the best steaks I've ever had! The crabcakes are awesome, too. Extensive wine list and excellent service. Highly recommend!!"
02/02/2013,Lauren,2.0,"If you have been to any good steak house in NYC then you will be disappointed here. The food was bland and overpriced. The waiter, while decent at recommending items, was overzealous and slow. We waited mutliple times for service when the restaurant was basically empty."
01/27/2013,AJFoodies,2.0,"Have eaten here on several occasions. The food is always consistent and good. , I was with a friend and we were seated next to this lovely couple. They were dining on Prime Rib and it looked delicious. They often dine on Sundays because there are specials offered between 4-6. Our waiter Robert W. never mentioned these specials, even though we were seated before 6. So I asked Robert about the special and he mentioned that there was Prime Rib and Short Ribs. I love short ribs and this is what I ordered. He mentioned it came on potato puree and some vegetables. He failed to mention that the Prime rib came with appetizer, veggies and dessert. A much better value which I would have opted for if I had known."
01/27/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,When I made the reservation at Open Table I requested a booth because my Mother-in-Law hears better when not surrounded by sound. FOr some reason that request never made it to the restaurant. We got a table and had a wonderful meal. Perhaps it was a computer glitch and I will double-check myself next time.
01/27/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Overall the dinning experience was great. We will be back.
01/26/2013,chatandchew,5.0,"our table was unfortunately close to the bar. the noise level was so distracting that we asked to wait for a quieter area.
hostess & managment were so understanding and receptive to our request.
we very much appreciated their attitude of being happy to please us.

our meal was leisurely and delicious.
our server suggested the garlic bread/blue cheese fondue appetizer.
we had read about the popularity of this app online so we decided to order one.
it was all that the raves suggested
we loved the filet mignon with gorgonzola crust cooked to a pefect med rare and also the scallops ... but not the squash puree they were served on.
lobster mashed potato side was delicious & different.
great non-rushed efficient service with a smile."
01/26/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Good day. I must say we had a very nice time Saturday night.
01/26/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Fab Fabulous Food. Always cooked perfect. This is the only restaurant I eat a steak in. The service was impeccable. Don't miss it!
01/26/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Excellent food and service, but a bit loud because of the bar area."
01/26/2013,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"I was very disappointed in the food. Ordered lettuce wedge; got two hearts of Romaine (including the cores which were very bitter). Wedge was served with a slab of bacon (not bacon crumbles) that was difficult to cut. Filet was over-cooked and, therefore, was bland in flavor. Side order of macaroni and cheese had undercooked pasta (almost crunchy). Garlic bread was AWESOME. My friends had lobster mashed potatoes and the kit-kat bars which were absolutely fantastic! Atmosphere was very nice and the service was impeccable. Unfortunately, I must have just made bad choices for my own dinner. Unfortunately, I will probably not be going back."
01/26/2013,Amanda,5.0,One of our favorite restaurants. We celebrate all of our special occasions here.
01/24/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Food was great, wine list was not a good as I expected"
01/21/2013,Gina,5.0,"Our waiter was amazing and so accomodating as my husband & I were with my parents age 91 and 89 enjoying a weekend gift we gave them for Christmas.
Our second visit and never disappointing!
R.L - East Greenbush NY"
01/20/2013,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Very long wait for food. Late for our show. Rib eye was almost all fat.
01/20/2013,eclipse689,5.0,The food was fantastic! Meat was cooked perfectly and the sides were portioned just right. Service was spot on and very friendly. We arrived 1/2 hour early and checked in with the hostess and headed to the bar. When we returned from the bar at our reservation time the table was ready and waiting for us. Definitely would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great atmosphere and steak!
01/20/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"This was our first time at Michael Jordan's. The food was great, our server Nancy was helpful and friendly.
We all ordered steak, they were tender and delicious and cooks exactly as we asked.
Great place to celebrate a special occasion or treat yourself to a wonderful meal."
01/20/2013,Mikeyy25,5.0,"From the service to the food, this was definitely a great pick. A little pricey, but that's expected. Definitely recommend checking it out."
01/19/2013,Happy,5.0,"Great night over all.I had the 8oz Filet. I told our server how Iliked my steak cooked and she suggested I order it medium plus. I never heard of that option before at any other steak house,but she was right on! My husband ordered the salmon and again our server was right on the mark. She explained the chef cooks it medium and if we liked it more cooked through we should order that way, we followed her suggestion and was done perfectly.Garlic bread for ap was to die for, Corn off the Cobb and Roasted Asparagus rounded off the meal. Sides are large enough for a couple of people to share. We were seated within a few minutes of our reservation time, which is a big plus if you have concert tickets"
01/19/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Always have an enjoyable time when there. Great food and service.
01/19/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"super fast & easy way to make dinner resv!
rec'd call back to confirm resv date/time."
01/18/2013,Lec987,4.0,"Delicious dinner. We split the beet salad and lobster bisque to start. Salad was well balanced nice flavor, bisque was ok - on the thin side and not a lot of lobster or lobster flavor. We ordered a crab cake (app) the filet and a side of asparagus for dinner, and split all three. Plenty of food for two. Crab cake had practically no filler. Steak cooked perfectly! Generous portion of asparagus. Baked Alaska for dessert was equally delicious. Also a large portion. Except for the soup it was a perfect meal!"
01/16/2013,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Paying %50 for a steak is crazy, no matter how good it is. With tip and a total of 2 glasses of wine, the meal cost us $100 each for my wife and I. Never again at those prices. And the filet was no more than 5-6 oz, not 8 oz. Sorry."
01/15/2013,Clocker,5.0,"We enjoyed another wonderful dinner at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse!
The steaks were cooked perfectly and the service was friendly and attentive.
We will definitely return to one of our favorite restaurants in the future!"
01/14/2013,dmrugg,4.0,Great dinner! Michael our server was awesome! Porterhouse for 2 a must!
01/13/2013,Oysterbay4,2.0,"Food was very average to below average. Garlic bread fondue was warm, not hot. Filet had no flavor - i think they rely on you to purchase the upgraded chars and sauces to give it flavor. The baked potato wasn't flaky, not much flavor. Wine list wasn't great for wine by the glass. And it came to $140 - i would think for that much money it would taste a bit better. Better off elsewhere."
01/13/2013,brewsta,4.0,We enjoy ourselves every time we go.
01/12/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"I have dined in many great Steakhouses and found Michael Jordan's to be right up there with the best of the best. The Garlic Bread, 28 day dry aged Kansas City Strip and the sides were fabulous.

01/12/2013,JoeB,4.0,"First and foremost...Great Food. Service was outstanding. Not inexpensive, but we came for a special occasion and knew what to expect. Menu, wine list and cocktail list readily available on web site. Dined on a Friday evening. It was busy....and consequently, a bit noisy. But other than that minor detail, this was an excellent dining experience."
01/12/2013,GINAD,5.0,Amazing garlic bread. Steaks cooked to perfection. Seating was spacious. Wait staff was great.
01/12/2013,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Very good steakhouse. We were disappointed that Mohegan Sun Restaurant Week ended the day before, when it appeared from the website that it continued through the 11th. Pricey, a la carte menu. Good wine list. Food was cooked well, very hot. Not a great value, but what steakhouses are? Excellent waitstaff. Overall, a good time, albeit an expensive night out."
01/10/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"My wife and I had a great dinner..her Filet was cooked absolutely perfect and you barely needed a knife to cut it. She is still talking about it. My ribeye was awesome. I can't say enough good about your service. It is great to be in a restaurant where ALL the servers are attentive, courteous, and professional. It made our dinner that much more enjoyable. Keep up the great work. You stand apart from most restaurants! We will be back very soon!

Scott king"
01/10/2013,RobertF,5.0,Excellent - except the mushrooms were totally un-eatable - very tough. We had to send them back. They replaced them (at no cost) with excellent spinach.
01/08/2013,rosie,4.0,"RESTAURANT WEEK $20.13 SPECIAL IS THE BEST DEAL. CHOICE OF SALAD,AND HANGER STEAK. MY ONLY COMPLAINT WAS THE SIDE OF SPINACH TASTED LIKE A FROZEN ITEM. CAN'T BELIEVE WITH EVERY THING THERE TOP CLASS THEY WOULD SERVE THAT."
01/07/2013,Momofthree,3.0,We were there for restaurant week at Mohegan Sun. The offer was not shown to us. If you did not know it was going on you would not be offererd the deal. The deal was a great one for a reasonable price. The hanger steak that my husband and I had was extremely salty. i have had better meals at Jordans before and was disappointed the time.
01/07/2013,PhilipN,2.0,food was average and would not recommend. We have been there before and this time shrimp cocktail was warm and not worth $16. Steak was average and not up to a good steak house rating. Not returning and will not recommend
01/06/2013,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"amazing food, great service. couldnt ask for anything more. i will be sure to return next time im at the casino for dinner whether its with a friend or a group"
01/06/2013,Perfect,5.0,Hands down the best steak I have ever had in my entire life. The prices are high but WELL worth every penny!!!
01/06/2013,DaveStock,5.0,"I'm not a steak person, but this was the best petite fillet I have ever had.

Will be going back........again and again."
01/05/2013,Puffy,3.0,"The food at MJ's is always great! The last time I was here, it was packed with a low volume and the food took forever. This time, we were seated closer to the bar, and it was considerably louder. However, the food came out quicker. The garlic bread with buttermilk blue cheese is a must to start off your dinner! The wine list is superb. It's so large that they give you an iPad to review the selections by categories. The only downside was that the filet mignon was order for medium and it came out medium rare, so we had to send that back for additional cook time. All in all good experience, but I wish we were seated in the less noisy area as we had our previous time there."
01/04/2013,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"We ordered two 8oz filets medium, I should of sent mine back it was well overdone. The waiter did ask me to cut my steak and there was a notable difference between both. Not even a inkling of pink in the center. I didn't send it back because I was starving and it took a while to get to the table. It was a tasty steak and the lobster mashed potatoes and asparagus were delicious. Even-though my steak was overdone I did enjoy it. I would recommend to try this place but wouldn't come back here often."
01/01/2013,Jacks,5.0,"I wish that they had child portions, a $40 steak for a 10 year old is little crazy, but they do not have sharing charges so that does help."
01/01/2013,Yummy,2.0,"Our reservation was for New Year's Eve and we never received the food we had ordered since the kitchen caught on fire. We had an appetizer and garlic bread and ended up spending $100 on bread and French fries. However, the waiter was professional and friendly but did not offer any compensation for a botched dinner. After all, it was New Year's Eve. Disappointing"
01/01/2013,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"Unfortunately when we were seated for our 10;30pm reservation on New Years Eve, a ""fire"" broke out in the kitchen. Initially it was suggested we order ""cold food"" salads, etc. After awhile, the waitress informed us that no more food from the kitchen was available.We complained for even being seated, and finally the manager said he would pay for what we ate.A good decision on his part, and we will return to Jordan'sGerard and Kathleen Saggese"
01/01/2013,Melanie,5.0,"Michael Jordan's has become my favorite celebratory location. Every time we go, we have a fantastic experience. The staff is superior. The food is awesome."
01/01/2013,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"Maybe because it was the most busiest day of the year, New Years Eve, our food was just fair. The service was excellent and the staff was very attentive. The king crab legs were dried out, the scallops were very sandy, but the steak was very good. If you plan on just getting a steak, then I would recommend it."
12/29/2012,Alli,5.0,I have been to Michael Jordan's previously and had the steak which I recall was quite good. This time I ordered the Arugula salad along with Salmon and both were excellent-my husband had the fillet and he said it was the best fillet he's ever had! I did splurge for dessert which is not the norm for me but I'm glad I had the Baked Alaska-it was fabulous. Be prepared for an expensive evening with everything a la carte but the food experience was well worth it.
12/29/2012,KPK21,5.0,"As always, a dining extravaganza !

We brought a 1st time couple to MJ's this weekend and they absolutly loved it as well.

Will we be back ??? You bet we will ! over & over again !"
12/29/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The food was delicious, although the steak was more medium than the medium rare we ordered. The fries with truffle oil and roasted asparagus were great additions. The resturant read my note on OpenTable indicating it was my girlfriend's birthday and they brought us a chocolate cake on the house. We'll be back again."
12/29/2012,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"The best part of this restaurant is the service. The staff is fantastic, very helpful and welcoming. The food is overpriced and just not that good. The garlic bread was the best thing! The steak is not worth the price. Stay away from the truffle fries and the mushrooms and onions side dishes, both were horrible. The fries were so bad, we could barely eat them."
12/29/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Everything was excellent. The service was fantastic. I was very impressed that when I made the reservation on OpenTable, I had requested a booth and noted that it was my boyfriend's birthday. Michael Jordan's gave me a booth and came over with a cake with a candle in it. I did not request the cake and was very impressed that it meant that they read my reservation and was able to not only give me a booth but also made it special for his birthday with the cake. The food was great, and overall just a wonderful experience."
12/29/2012,ScottH,5.0,"The food was outstanding and the sides were generous and equally interesting...grilled corn, mushrooms and onions and grilled asparagus. The bone in rib-eye was outstanding and cooked to our liking. The wine list was equally interesting...found a terrific Pride Family Cabernet for $180...a fair restaurant price for that wine. The service was truly outstanding...everyone, from the person who sat us to the assistants to Michael, our waiter...perfect night!"
12/28/2012,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"The salads were too cold, like they just came out of the fridge/freeze. Salads should be served at room temperature. The beet salad was disappointing--it was bland. The Ceasar salad was too cold and dry; it had no dressing.
The creme breulee was too cold.
The porterhouse steak was only acceptable; nothing to rave about."
12/28/2012,ChristineK,4.0,Food and service were wonderful!
12/27/2012,Aggie188,5.0,It is a steak house and a very good one at that. We have eaten there on more than several occasions and have never been disappointed. I go to Mohegan Sun once a month and when I'm alone I eat at the bar. The bar food is excellent as well and they have terrific specials. The bartenders are very experiences and knowledgeable.
12/25/2012,BillT,5.0,"This was our third year for going to MJs on Christmas Day and it did not disappoint. Our table of three had 1 NY strip, 1 KC strip and 1 short rib all of which were perfectly prepared and presented. The flavor was excellent. We also enjoyed the tuna tartar. Service was excellent as well."
12/25/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Wonderful place to eat excellent food!!!
12/24/2012,Dave,3.0,"This was our favorite place to eat at Mohegan over the years, but it has slipped quite noticeably over the past two years. The service was excellent, but the quality of the tenderloin and other dishes is not up to standard."
12/23/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellent food and service. A little pricy. Would recommend it to everyone.E
12/23/2012,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"Been here over 10 times always exceptional, not this time"
12/23/2012,Amysgw,4.0,"Great service, fabulous atmosphere, delicious food! We were pleased from begining to end! - Ahi Tuna Tartare
Soy-sesame vinaigrette, wonton chips is a must!"
12/23/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We enjoyed ourselves very much! The food was outstanding and our waitress had wonderful suggestions that we were very pleased we listened to. Keep up the good work. Will be making reservations there for our next trip to Mohegan Sun!
12/22/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The steaks are full of flavor and cooked perfectly as asked which they should be if you consider yourself a steak house. Garlic bread with a fondue bluecheese dressing is a must have? Staff was always checking on you but not overbearing. Menu is a little pricey but when the food is this good you don't mind paying. I highly recommend MJ's
12/17/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Our dining experience was fabulous; however, the wine list was pricey."
12/15/2012,KPK21,5.0,"As always, MJ's does it right. The crew at MJ's is fantastic. The service is impecable. The food is out of this world."
12/15/2012,DarrellM,4.0,It was better than ok but not excellent. It was too loud and too busy. The steak was very good
12/11/2012,goldrush,3.0,"Sorry to say, we weren't to pleased. My lamb shanks were just O.K. and my wifes 8 oz. filet (which she asked to be butterflied) was served as to pieces that looked like 1/4 pounders and were well overcooked. At those prices I would have expected much more. Sorry, I usually don't post negative reviews, I just don't go back."
12/09/2012,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"booked a table for 4 @ 6.30pm prior to seeing WHO concert
Arrived at 6.20 ; reservation checked by receptionist - asked to wait in bar
Friends traveling down from New York city to meet us
Around 6.30 we asked to be seated as bar area very noisy and for a table in the quieter area of the restaurant - receptionist said she would try- but still ended up in a noisy area
Then she asked us to wait again because our guests were still valet parking
- I asked to be seated; asked to wait for guests - past our table time
at the third time of asking we were seated at our table and our friends arrived hot foot from valet parking
- ordered tuna appetizer - but restaurant had run out at 6.45 pm!!
- malbec wine (notable wine)but wine not avai"
12/09/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Steak was absolutely perfect. Salad and mashed potatoes were delicious too. Might have been one of my favorite meals ever! It is pretty pricey (steak, side salad and side mashed potatoes was 75 bucks per person not including drinks) but worth every penny! The perfect place for an anniversary, birthday, or special occasion dinner!"
12/09/2012,JeriA,3.0,"Food was good and sides were plenty for sharing. Service was less than it should be for the price point of the establishment. Very noisy, difficult to hold a conversation."
12/08/2012,Markandlibby,4.0,Food is always fantastic. The steaks here are incredible and the wine selection top notch. The service was lacking though. I had reservations and still had to wait for a table. Once seated it took 20 minutes to see a waitress. The bussers kept apologizing and bringing water but we couldn't even get a drink.
12/08/2012,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"Bottom line: Good food but overpriced and Outback style atmosphere.

This is a good steakhouse, but the prices are too high for what it is. The big noisy atmosphere is like an Outback. The service is attentive but a little cheesy and low end -- they try to upsell you on everything. We declined the garlic bread appetizer because we thought we would be to full. Only THEN did the wiaitress suggest the half order which is NOT on the menu. Her recommendation of the bone-in ribeye as the tastiest steak on the menu just happened to be the most expensive on the menu ($52!). It was obvious that she had been instructed to do that. I felt like a tourist in Disney. But the steak was tasty."
12/08/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food and service were great. To die for garlic bread with blue cheese! Excellent lobster tails!
12/06/2012,Clocker,5.0,"Great food and attentive service.
We always enjoy dining at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse!"
12/05/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"I hadn't been to the restaurant personally, but had heard positive reviews. I booked a holiday dinner with a good client. We were a party of 6 and each one of us were equally delighted with our food. The service was attentive but not intrusive. Overall a wonderful experience and I will definitely be frequenting Michael Jordan's Steakhouse!"
12/02/2012,Yumzymumsy,3.0,Enjoyed the food... just bummed that our reservation was not ready when we got there - made a reservation well ahead of time and when we arrived waited a good 25 minutes before being seated at a lousy table. Place too crowded to ask to be changed. Waitress also dissapeared twice for extended length of time during the course of the evening...
12/01/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Always love coming here when at Mohegan Sun. Everything on the Menu is great!
12/01/2012,PatriciaB,5.0,Expensive but WORTH every dollar! Great food and service!
11/30/2012,Paolo,4.0,5 Star review for everything but the value. Very overpriced.
11/29/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Great service. Loved the corn off the cob. Didn't live the lobster mashed potatoes. While food was good, it is over priced. I would only go for a special occasion."
11/26/2012,CesarSalad,4.0,Wish that Primerib wwould be on the menu more often. The Delmonico delicious. Service is outstanding.
11/25/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Everything was delicious and the service was excellent!
11/24/2012,Aljr,4.0,"Ok so apps were awesome- bacon & garlic bread!
Caesar salad -split ...could have been colder ie chilled plate, fork.
Baker was huge- not enuff toppings for a one pounder.
Onions and mushrooms- fabulous!
Steaks- my Kansas strip mid rare PERFECT! My girlfriends petit filet mid rare slightly over cooked more medium so knowing her love for
red meat I offered to send it back for her- our server was very accomidating -my girlfriend refused because she did not want my birthday meal to get cold. It was my girlfriends first trip to Jordans.....you know what they say about first impressions.
Anyhow.... being in the business im not really sure how one might remedy such a situation?"
11/24/2012,Allaroundwonderful,4.0,"Cool atmosphere, had a multitude of servers and could not keep track of who to ask for things from. Steak was average - not anymore special than I can make at home so that was disappointing, I even got the steak that was recommended as the best one to get. I probably won't go back, the prices definitely did not reflect the quality."
11/24/2012,susano,3.0,We had a nice dinner and the service was very good. I think the menu is overpriced for what you get.
11/23/2012,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"Been to MJ's before and the food was excellent. Was expecting the same, but unfortunately they didn't even come close to meeting my expectations. My wife's and son's filets where burnt and the lobster mash tasted like it came out of an aquarium. Seriously disappointed and will not go back. We don't mind paying for quality- but the food was anything but."
11/23/2012,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Food was decent and met, but did not exceed expectations. We did not like the changes to the menu."
11/23/2012,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Just about the only thing I can rave about was the wine list. It was excellent and the 2008 Stag's Leap we had was great. But the steak was dry and the sides were neither interesting or that fantastic.
11/22/2012,Katya82,5.0,The STEAK was amazing.... one of the best steak house my boyfriend and I ever been to.
11/18/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Amazing! Waiter, Ryan, was fantastic and made our night! Food was soooooo delicious-from appetizers to steaks that we're cooked to perfection! Garlic bread with blue cheese suce appetizer is #1 - and lobster mashed potatoes were so good! Will definitely be back!!"
11/17/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Everything was very well done!! I run a upscale function facility and the service was very good and the food was prepared very well. Nice job
11/12/2012,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Great atmosphere and service. Steak was poorly cooked. Order medium, received well done and chared on outside."
11/12/2012,caroll,2.0,"waited a long time even though we had reservations, did not think the food was worth the price. overrated, would not go back there"
11/11/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Michael Jordon's was BUSY on Sunday and, while the service was slightly delayed, there was not loss in quality of food from appetizer to dessert. A truly great steakhouse!"
11/11/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Every time we go to Michael Jordan's it's a wonderful experience. From the minute we walked in until we left, it was perfect. Not one even tiny complaint!"
11/11/2012,JoeH,5.0,Went on Sunday for the Prime Rib special. $25 included sides. It was very good. Had the crab cake for an appetizer. It was fabulous. $19 and worth it. Pure crab meat. Wonderful. Also had the best baked Alaska I've ever had. Wish I had an opportunity to try the 23 layer cake. Next time. Staff was fabulous.
11/11/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Good food excellent service, the prices are a
little on the higher side but understandably so."
11/11/2012,LisaB,1.0,"I wasnt impressed with size/quality/flavor/tenderness of the steak for the cost.Filet Mignon ($39)Waitress seemed to be upset that we did not order appetizers and was offering us items we didnt ask for in my opinion to ""run up the bill""
portion size for cost of items was extremely small. Wedge salad in particular. Blue cheese dressing was ""runny"" and I was hoping for bleu cheese crumble for the price ($12) paid.Portion sizes for side dishes was good but considering that they are ala carte items the mash potato and corn dish increased my meal by an additional $18 making my meal $69.00 for salad/steak/potato and vegetable and I left hungry.
With tip of ($27.00) 20%, my anniversary dinner for 2 cost $162.01 and we left hungry."
11/11/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Awesome food, awesome ambiance, awesome service!!!"
11/10/2012,TrvlSnobs,5.0,"We highly recommend this restaurant.  Have eaten at the other fine dining places in the casino and this is the BEST by far.  We both had the seared scallops, beets with goat cheese and dessert.  It's well worth the extra cash!  Treat yourself, you won't regret it!!"
11/10/2012,DaveB,5.0,"Service was outstanding!!
Food was perfectly prepared. This is a great place to eat, but, due to the price, for special occasions only (at least for us)."
11/10/2012,Chope,3.0,"My steak was so over cooked that the waitress, who was excellent, took it back without even asking me. The second one came out and it was rare. I had ordered medium rare. I did not even bother to send back. My wife had the scallop dish. It was decent. The scallops were a little undercooked and I thought the flavor combination was a little strange. Bottom line, you order a $54 bone in filet mignon, the quality of the meat should be better an it should be cooked perfectly. Would not return."
11/09/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Very good steak house- our steaks were done as ordered and were quite tender. Service was quick. The restaurant is quite large since it caters to a casino crowd; I am not used to that noise level.
11/04/2012,Kara,2.0,"Usually I love this place. However, the table that I was sat at was in the back corner of the restaurant, practically on top of the server's station. They were constantly walking around our table and talking clanking silverware. It was distracting and made for a terrible experience. I would only return if I am able to secure a booth upon reserving a table. This was just terrible."
11/03/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Love the food, the best. We have been a few times and the service is great we will return again, thank you."
11/02/2012,nancycrg,4.0,We love going to Michael Jordans for the food. Wouldn't go anywhere else!
10/28/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Outstanding food and great service, took the kids and they loved it!"
10/27/2012,Chris,5.0,"loved everything about my experience, however, the apps. and salads in my opinion need to be a little a little twicking."
10/26/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Steaks were perfect. Excellent service. Appreciate the surprise champagne for my wife's birthday.
10/23/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"good time, thanks the manager that went out of his way to make our dinner amazing. Thank you."
10/22/2012,DebbieW,5.0,"It was a wonderful evening, until the bill arrived! They gave us an Ipad to make our wine selection and we chose one called DuckOne, a Pinot Noir from California - $60.00 was the price listed next to it! Bill arrived and we were charged $129.00 for the wine and we were told the $60.00 was a half bottle price? Nobody said anything to us when we ordered it and nothing was listed on the Ipad when we checked the 2nd time.

The manager did fix the bill - but they need to fix that problem!
Other than that - I would return!"
10/21/2012,Afriged,5.0,As always M.J Steakhouse is flawless in every ways.
10/21/2012,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"We made a special effort to abide by their online requirement of business casual dress. More than 50% were dressed in jeans, shorts, sneakers, tee shirts, etc. In fairness, they should update the dress code to ""anything goes"". When visiting a casino, I prefer casual dress vs business casual dress."
10/20/2012,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"The service was good, but I did not like my meal at all. I had the fish special that the waitress recommended and it was very dry. However, my boyfriend had a steak and said he enjoyed it. We were seated in the back with a large group next to us, but we actually appreciated it because the main dinning room seemed loud. I was not a fan of the restaurant and it did not compare to any of the Boston steak houses like Abe and Louis, Flemings or Capital Grill."
10/20/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Food was excellent as well as the service. The seafood tower was an impressive site and the freshness equaled it's appearance.
10/20/2012,Dave,3.0,"We go here quite often when we are at the Mohegan, but found that this experience was below par."
10/20/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Went to MJ's for a special dinner engagement for 2. I used open table to set the reservation. Our seating accommodations were in the booth area with pillows. It was romantic and fun. Ordered 2 apps, ofcourse steak and the seasonal pumpkin martini's. Our waiter was very attentive and patient. A a great dining experience!"
10/20/2012,Sandy,3.0,"I was upset because I had booked the reservation way in advance and specifically asked for the romantic booth as it is our anniversary. The hostess didn't even try to accomodate us, she just said oh well their taken.There were other tables available that could have worked for us but she didn't even try. Instead she put us in the center of the floor I felt like I was on display in a cafeteria. The mac and cheese is usually off the hook but this time it tasted like it was from a box. The shrimp cocktail was tough like over cooked. The rest of the meal was delicious and our waiter Robert was outstanding, he was so very nice and smiled the whole time."
10/19/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Not my favorite visit, but its a great place for a steak and drink."
10/19/2012,Ltoplee,5.0,The food was fantastic and the wait staff extremely attentive.The sides are enough for 2-4 people. Our steaks were cooked to perfection. We will go back again when in the area.
10/13/2012,KPK21,5.0,Mj's always has a professional touch to an elegant meal. We eat there atleast 25 times a year.
10/12/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Food was delicious. Server, buser and person who brought food to table were friendly, pleasant and helpful. We were given a table in the very back of restaurant in an empty room although there were plenty of empty tables in the dining room. Also, we were given a 2-top and people arriving behind us were given tables in the front dining room and they were 4-tops. Since we were in the very last table in restaurant the joke was ""did you do something wrong to be sent here"" or ""was it something you said?"". We still had a nice time and enjoyed our meal and our server. However, I think best tables should be filled first and then no one would mind sitting anywhere else."
10/12/2012,JasonH,5.0,One of the most memorable meals I have had in a long time. Get the garlic bread!
10/11/2012,April,5.0,A little pricey so recommend for special occasion-Chef's garlic bread with bleu cheese fondue was delightful! Creamy spinach was our favorite veggie! Beef was cooked perfect-
10/07/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,My wife and I drove an hour for our 22nd wedding anniversary dinner. The food was awesome and the wait staff was great. We can't wait to go back.
10/07/2012,MediumRare,5.0,Outstanding food and service.  Highly recommended.
10/07/2012,NicoleC,4.0,Food was excellent! Server was kind of rude...not accommodating.
10/06/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,On the pricey side but if you enjoy a really good steak this is a great place. Wine list's is also on the high end. Service was very good but we were not there at prime time.
10/05/2012,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"For a steak house, I was not impressed with the quality of the steak. It was a little dry and not as flavorful as I expected. It is also a bit more expensice than warranted."
10/05/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Always' exceeds out expectiona!
10/04/2012,Thinglet,5.0,"I have dined at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse several times and never been disappointed. The food is exceptional quality, service has always been great, and most important, I always feel comfortable !!"
10/03/2012,RobinsonB,5.0,This was an annivesary occasion. We have dined at Michael Jordon's before and always found it to be an enjoyable experience. Service is excellent and the special accomidations that I had asked for were met.
09/30/2012,MitchK,4.0,"My wife LOVES your scalops.... Well Done of course... they were cooked to perfection, but could have used a drizzle or two of butter to make them moist... she opted out of the sauce that they came with, so it was her own fault, but still someone should have known that they would be dry and have given them something to moisten them a little bit."
09/29/2012,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Expected abit more ambiance for an upscale steakhouse.Ordered the porterhouse for 2 have a hardtime believing it was afull 32oz. cut
09/29/2012,WilliamC,5.0,"The food was outstanding. Brian, our waiter was very attentive and took the time to explain the menu and wine selection. As one of our party had several food allergies, it was a pleasant surprise that they were able to provide several dishes that were safe."
09/29/2012,ChristopherS,5.0,Staff highly accomodating and attentive. Food is always a home run. Atmosphere is inviting and comfortable.
09/28/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Wonderfull atmospher for our Anniversary and great food.
09/28/2012,Afriged,5.0,As always... PERFECTION in every ways.
09/24/2012,PeggyD,5.0,"The seafood platter and garlic bread appetizers were excellent. Of course, you expect good steaks but the corn side dish surprised my guests (it was terrific)."
09/23/2012,KevinR,5.0,Fabulous food and service as always. We've never had a bad experience or meal and we have been therenat least 15 times.
09/22/2012,KayN,3.0,Service was a bit slow even though restaurant was not overly busy. Took almost 10 minutes to get a wine list. Food is always consistent and good. There are not many good restaurants at Mohegan Sun. It is the best restaurant at Mohegan Sun.
09/22/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,An orgiastic feast for my senses!
09/21/2012,cell,5.0,From start to finish a wonderful meal.
09/19/2012,Linda,3.0,"The wait staff was good and the atmosphere was good, however the dinner portion of our meal was disappointing. We ordered the porterhouse for two with an oscar topping. The steak had no flavor and was vainy. The oscar topping was very fishy smelling and tasty. Not at all appetizing. The appetizers were good and the sides served with the meal was also good. The steak was disappointing. We had eaten at this restaurant before and have always had a good experience. So this was really disappointing."
09/19/2012,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"My wife and I have been many times to this restaurant and returned for my wife's birthday. This was our first disappointing experience. The lobster chowder and the king crab legs were awful. The beet salad was simply ok. The steak, potatoes, and beans were excellent. The music being played was to loud and not conducive to this type atmosphere. Sad to say we will not be returning soon."
09/18/2012,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"As steak houses go this one is ok, I thought the steak was not as good as other steak houses in this price range. My real complaint was my rib-eye was overly fatty which rib-eyes tend to be but this one was way to much."
09/16/2012,OpenTable Diner,1.0,food was not adequate portions very expensive and food was not good at all also had a sangria have no clue what she gave me was not a sangria would defentley not recommend this restraunt
09/15/2012,AmyB,2.0,"Usually we are quite happy after a meal at Michael Jordan's but Saturday was too busy, too loud and although I had made a reservation over a week ahead we had to wait 40 minutes for our table. Service was very slow, we had to ask someone to find our waiter because we wanted to order and he wasn't there.

We had brought a business associate and his wife with us and were disappointed and quite frankly embarrassed because we had spoken so highly of the restaurant before we arrived."
09/15/2012,Nancy,3.0,"Very expensive for what you get. My steak for$40 was half fat should of sent it back,but I was hungry . I am female and only eat about 5oz of meat but there were no leftover after eating around the fat I was told it was a 12oz steak! Everything is extra nothing comes with your steak. The service is good and if you have money to burn this is your place ."
09/14/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,I was not impressed with steak as I have been with other notable steak restaurants similarly priced.
09/13/2012,Dave,5.0,Celebrating our 43rd wedding anniversary. Excellent.
09/10/2012,Woodman,4.0,"MJ's lamb chops are hard to beat. They were outstanding. The Tuna Tartare was very good.
Only the bread did not measure up. Although served up nicely warmed, both offerings were a bit dry and tasteless. Not awful, but not very good. Any restaurant to rate ""Outstanding"" should start things off with a superior bread."
09/07/2012,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"It was my first time at Michael Jordans Steakhouse, i had very high expectations due to friends and family telling me how it was. The food was delicious, my filet was cooked perfectly, the service on the other hand was not so great, we waited about 15-20 min for our drinks, we rarely saw our waitress, and when we did she seemed in a rush to do something else. I would reccomend doing lunch, the food was amazing, but for the price of dinner the service should have been better."
09/05/2012,mlfpvd,4.0,A really good steak at the casino. Likely the best food in the whole place.
09/03/2012,LuisC,5.0,"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary there (we like to seriously splurge for that meal, and everything was fantastic. That was probably the best steak I've ever had."
09/03/2012,Traveler,5.0,Great food. Been there multiple times and always very good and consistent.
09/02/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The Sunday $25.00 pp prime rib dinner was great It included salad, garlic bread, potato, spinach soufflé, a nice tasty portion of beef plus desert!!"
09/02/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Expensive. Ruth's Chris would have been better.
08/31/2012,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Food was predictably good, but way too expensive ($250 for 3 people with only a split of domestic wine.) The noise level was such that pleasant conversation was not possible. Even thought the restaurant was not crowded, we felt rushed to order, eat and leave."
08/31/2012,Pattie,5.0,I always look forward to dining at Michael Jordan's at Mohegan Sun. Excellent service and accommodating............Highly recommend this restaurant.
08/30/2012,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"Have been to restaurant many times and have always been more than satisfied, however, this time my husbands steak wasn't prepared properly,way overcooked ,even though waitress asked how he would like it. My lamb chops were great. Waiter wanted to prepare another but that would take time,leaving my dinner finished and my husband eating alone. We completed our meal and waiter started to clear plates. The waiter placed every dish and silverware that was on the table , piling everthing on one arm, well, you know what happened, a disaster waiting to happen,which it did, everthing fell all over table and my husbands slacks which were a mess. Waitress brings wipes,not charged for steak.manager very courteous.we will return again.things happen"
08/29/2012,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"We have been wanting to try this restaurant for some time and decided to go for our anniversary. We were seated promptly, served promptly...though I felt the wait between courses was a bit long. There was a bit of a push by our waitperson to add on appetizers, drinks, etc....I don't find that to be as appropriate in a fine dining place.
The noise level was too high, we could talk to each other, but at times, the music and noise interfered.
The food was expensive and Unremarkable. It was average fare.
We will not be going back."
08/26/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Michael Jordan's food is consistently outstanding. The staff is friendly and attentive and we really enjoy having dinner there. I had their wild salmon wrapped in prochutto - it was moist and tasty!
08/26/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,I really loved the food. The resturant was a little on the noisey side and the service was slower than I like.
08/25/2012,LarsL,4.0,nice location at mohegan sun..bartenders are very friendly and know their job...pleasure to eat there
08/25/2012,CindyL,5.0,"We are always tempted to try an alternate restaurant when we visit Mohegan Sun but we cannot resist Michael Jordan Steakhouse. And as usual, Michael Jordan Steakhouse did not disappoint us -- Kudos to our server, who was fabulous, attentive, perfect :) From appetizer to dessert, absolute perfection. Can't wait to return!"
08/25/2012,TammyT,4.0,"This is by far the best filet that my husband and I have ever had, well worth it!"
08/24/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE WITH GREAT SERVICE AND FOOD. ENJOYED THE DECOR AS WELL. I WPOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT TO A FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER.
08/22/2012,Ma3ty,4.0,Food was great. Service was very good. They have issues with taking gift cards. It took 30 minutes to process check. That's crazy!!
08/21/2012,casino12,5.0,"I love the restaurant. I ordered the lobster special and was disappointed in the
meal. It was not what I expected. Yu cannot go wrong when you order a steak there,
and that is what I will do i the future. Service excellent."
08/19/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Went to dinner for my birthday, the staff was outstanding and very attentive, the food was excellent."
08/19/2012,Cymba,2.0,"Our first experience at MJ's Steakhouse was outstanding but not so our second. In their defense it was an extremely busy night with nearly every table taken but the restaurant was far below fine dining standards. First, our requested table was not honored, nor was any attempt made to let us know this prior to arriving at the restaurant ( they stated they didn't know which table we wanted yet failed to clarify). It took a very long time for our starters to arrive, then, when they did finally come, the salads were served along with them. The server claimed that some people like to have all their first courses at once and acted as if i were strange to want some time/space in between courses. Overall very poor!"
08/19/2012,EaterNY24,4.0,The food was wonderful.  The lamb was one of the best I have ever had.  The waitress was not very attentive though.
08/17/2012,CINDYG,5.0,Great food. Only downside is that it is too loud and hard to hold a conversation or hear your waiter/waitress.
08/17/2012,JohnB,4.0,Food and service were great with the exception of Michael's home fried potatoes which were greasy and bland. Would definately go back and the couple we were with also loved MJ's Resturant.
08/17/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Everyone in our party thoroughly enjoyed their meal. Everything was cooked perfectly as ordered. The portions are very generous. Our waiter, Michael and his assistant, Nick, helped make the entire experience extremely enjoyable. They made great suggestions from both the food menu and the drink/wine menu. The only possible concern was the noise level. Two of the ladies in our party were a bit older, so they thought it was a little loud and difficult to have a conversation. The rest of us in the group had no problem with the noise level."
08/15/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Everything ordered was delicious. Not a huge issue, but I had to break some rules on a personal diet to eat there, but it was worth it. Reasonable prices for upscale place."
08/15/2012,GandG,5.0,The bone-in filet mignon was perfectly prepared and we enjoyed every bite of this delicacy along with the bacon appetizer which was amazingly delicious!
08/15/2012,Zeketurd,5.0,We celebrated our one year wedding anniversary and we tried like relatives to MJ. We received free champagne our serve was extremely pleasant and helpful he even went next door to get dressing that they didn't have in house. We ate our bellys full. It was such a lovely night.
08/12/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,food was excellent----everything was first rate. tad pricey but worth it
08/11/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Love everything about this restaurant. However the highlight here is the Garlic bread with Blue Cheese fondue! Love it!
08/11/2012,bobthetomato,4.0,"While a chain restaurant, each MJ's Steakhouse manages to provide its own unique ambience and style.  An excellent, straight-up steakhouse with great service, generous portions and an admirable wine list."
08/11/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Exceeded our expecations. Only knock would be knowing the price of all the specials. Similar item on the main menu without garnish for $15 less. From the appetizers which were great (fondue excellent) to main course and coffee was exceptional. Looking forward to the next occation.
08/10/2012,WillJoy2014,3.0,"Considering the price, I had much higher expectations that the restaurant did not meet, so I was disappointed in that. But the wait staff was excellent, very professional and attentive, I just wish the food had lived up to the price and expectations."
08/10/2012,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Great food, you certainly pay for it though.
Air conditioner was dripping on our heads but everything else perfect.
Nice champaign on the house for our anniversary."
08/10/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellent food. Excllent service. Warm and inviting atmosphere.
08/09/2012,Kareness,4.0,"The steak was cooked perfectly...not always the case, even in fine steakhouses. The home fries were delicious, although I wouldn't call them home fries."
08/05/2012,karemel,4.0,"Can't remember the last time dinner at MJ's wasn't great as well as the service and attention paid to special requests (booths, etc). It's generally the highlight of going to Mohegan Sun."
07/31/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,I can't believe that they took the Kansas City strip steak off the menu. It was the main reason that we kept coming back after all these years.
07/31/2012,Mayor,4.0,"The bone in prime Filet was one of the best I have ever had. I ordered it Pittsburgh Medium Rare, and it was cooked exactly as ordered. The Caesar Salad was plentiful, the dressing excellent. Their Creamed Spinach was excellent, it was served in a small cast iron skillet, and had a wonderful parmesean cheese crust. I was very impressed with this restaurant, and would heartily recommend it. My server was attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu, and although he was busy with other diners he never left me stranded."
07/31/2012,Toddmcohen,5.0,"I thought the ambiance, decor, food and service were all oustanding. Honestly, we loved the dinner and had a great time...Thank you..."

07/26/2012,Jkg0105,5.0,Fantastic dinner! Highly recommend the filet!
07/26/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The crab cake is a must have, best deal for $19. All jumbo lump crab, no filling. The tuna tartare appetizer and grilled corn side dish are also fantastic. The lobster special entree with cream corn was also very good. Steak is why people go there but everything else is better."
07/22/2012,CTfoodie,5.0,"Always a great meal, wine and service. A little louder than I would like would be my only criticism."
07/22/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,This is now my second time at the restaurant. Everything was amazing from start to finish. The steak was cooked to perfection and melted with each bite. I can't wait until next time.
07/22/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The dinner was amazing. You will be hard pressed to find any restaurant with the quality of steaks that they have. The service was excellent and we never needed for anything. The prices are high but totally worth it once you take a bite of the steak. I highly recommend going there even if just for a special occasion. It's very worth it! I have been there 3 times now and I have never been disappointed any time.
07/21/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Love the food and the service is great!!!
07/21/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Quite an amazing time, best part was the food. We do go to restaurants to eat well and this is one of those places."
07/21/2012,Linda,5.0,The steaks here are wonderful so tender and flavorful. Great for romance dining
07/15/2012,Bostonbabs,5.0,This is a wonderful restaurant. The garlic bread is unbelievable.
07/14/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We NEVER have a bad dinner here, we only travel the 1.5 hours to get there a couple times a year and it is always perfect. Will not disappoint and worth every penny."
07/13/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We always enjoy the food and service at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse. We thank Open Table for assisting us with reservations.
07/12/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Food was excellant....pricey. Our steak was cooked exactly as we asked for it. Highly recommend this restaurant.
07/12/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Service and food were good. We were seated on time. It was much too noisy for dinner.
07/11/2012,Ninnafadinna,5.0,"Try the arugula salad--it is tasty and piquant. Creamed spinach is creamy but light at the same time. Steaks are always great, too."
07/07/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"You get what you pay for. . . We got 2 steaks, one side and 3 glasses of wine and paid almost 200 dollars. Amazing food but most people can't afford it."
07/06/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,As usual everything was just perfect!
07/05/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Steaks were perfect.....sides were great. Pricey but worth it, which is rare."
07/04/2012,Birthdaydinner,4.0,"For the price of this steakhouse I was expecting a bit more of a high end setting. Also, the quality of the food wasn't what I am looking for when I order a steak for $50. I don't mind spending the money if it is worth the quality. Good drink menu."
07/02/2012,pacmangolf,4.0,A very loud night at Michael Jordans.  Crowded and loud food was good but that was all it was very loud
07/02/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We really enjoy Michael Jordon's and had another excellent experience this week. It is a must visit for us anytime we are at the casino. The service was friendly and attentive and we felt welcomed. As always, the food is great too!"
06/30/2012,danny4,4.0,A nice dinner with exceptional service
06/29/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Our experience was very positive. This was our second time dinning at the steakhouse. The first time we ate in the bar area because it was a spontaneous last minute decision. I wish I had reserved one of the booths along the wall but I am not certain if that is possible through open table. Food was EXCELLENT!
06/24/2012,Namret,2.0,Only Choice grade steaks. Hmmmmm.  Not impressed
06/24/2012,Emine,5.0,The employees were awesome to say the least. Everything and everybody was wonderful! Made my Boyfriends Birthday even more special :)
06/24/2012,Dave,5.0,"Exceptional dinning! A must if not already experienced. Great food, reasonable priced compared to other steakhouses in the area and one of my favorates."
06/23/2012,WilliamR,5.0,My wife & I celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse-Mohegan Sun & we had an outstanding experience!
06/23/2012,aaronm,5.0,steaks are prepared perfectly. service was top quality. will continue patrnage there. reccomend highly.
06/22/2012,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Having made reservations in advance I thought we would be sat at a nicer situation, we were sat right next to the front Maitre'd podium which was obviously a bit noisier with people coming and going when there were plenty of seats deeper into the floor plan which would have been nicer. It was like ""lets just drop them here since I don't feel like walking too far!"". The waitress was very good though as one would expect at a place like that. I'm not complaining about the price since I expected it to be above average, and my steak was excellant."
06/22/2012,karemel,4.0,has always been a great place to relax and have drinks and dinner.
06/22/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Had an awesome dinner. Started with the Lump Crab Cake, which was the best I ever had. Filet Mignon w/Lobster Tail was perfect, and the Turtle Cheesecake for dessert was the best. Cannot wait to go back there."
06/22/2012,gene,5.0,best visit of the many times I have been there
06/19/2012,Liss,4.0,Very good food for the price. Very nice ambiance except for the old hacking man at the table next to us but the restaurant can't do anything about that. Would definitely recommend to someone and I plan of going back for a special occasion!
06/19/2012,NHCAPPY,5.0,"Excellent! Food and service were top notch. Drinks mixed perfectly. Pace of service was great. A bit noisy but with all that hard surface probably not much could be done. The aie conditioning was a bit cold and they promptly turned it down, even a manager came to ask us if it was ok. expensive but worth it."
06/18/2012,JStinson,5.0,Great Food! Wine list is good as well. Staff is very friendly and helpful!
06/18/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Amazing night and great food. Waitress was absolutely incredible!
06/17/2012,Cathy,5.0,"Fantastic steaks and sides, beautiful room, and of course their famous garlic bread. What more could you ask for? It's not cheap, but everything is done right here."
06/17/2012,Mariceann,3.0,Music loud and tables very close together. Makes it difficult to have a conversation.
06/17/2012,MelissaG,4.0,"The Prime Rib Sunday family style dinner is a great deal! $25 per person. You start with an appetizer of garlic bread with a mild but creamy blue cheese fondue to share, next us is caesar salads. Once the main course arrives each diner gets a good sized prime rib (cooked near perfectly), and then mashed potatoes and creamed spinach to share. The creamed spinach was garlicky and had a parmesean crust that complemented it nicely. And for dessert an apple cobbler to share. The portions sizes were really good, not too bit or too small.
My only complaint is that the wine list could use a couple more accessible bottles. They had plenty of nice labels on the higher end of the scale."
06/16/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Our server Danielle was exceptional!
06/10/2012,KennethB,4.0,great steak delmonico and special garlic bread. Food served very hot
06/09/2012,CesarSalad,4.0,Service is excellent. The food is great. Just a bit too noisy.
06/09/2012,judy,5.0,"had a great time, food was great"
06/09/2012,pacmangolf,5.0,Great meal before the show. On a very busy night our 630 table was waiting for us when we walked in. Our server was great and we had the back room away from all of the noise that this place has on a crowded night. Love that room. Seared scallops for one of us and the fillet and crab cake for the other. Only one word needed here...WOW...Dont miss it when at the Sun. Pricey but the food is OVER THE TOP GREAT
06/08/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,I thought the service was and the food was fantastic.
06/07/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"A lovely dinner; delicious steak, chops, and ""oh that garlic/cheese bread""!!!"
06/02/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food and atmosphere was incredible. We celebrated our 25th Wedding Anniversary. Our server it made it extra special with complimentary glasses of champagne. Would definately go again to Michael Jordan's.
06/02/2012,Gene,4.0,Excellent service and food. I have eaten here multiple times and this was the first time my main course meat dish was less than outstanding. The ribeye steak was too chewy.
06/02/2012,JudiC,4.0,Always consistently good. Steak was cooked to perfection.
05/31/2012,josephmpalladino,5.0,"Some of the best steaks you wil ever have, however, they are more then jsut about steak. Lamb chops, chicken and fish prepared just as you want them. Service was prompt and courteous."
05/30/2012,RickS,5.0,A few buddies and I came here for a bachelor dinner. It was a Wednesday night so the place was quite tame. The service was outstanding. They have an excellent wine list - as any steak place should. All of our steaks were cooked perfectly and the waiting staff was there to ensure we were 100% satisfied.
05/28/2012,PatrickG,2.0,"We have ben a fan of Michael Jordan's Steakhouse @ Mohegan Sun from the begining, but I have to say that the last two times we have gone we were very disappointed the quality of the steaks have gone down hill. The side dishes and the apps. are still great but that is not enough for me to come back any more. I do understand that you can have off nigths but when your tab is $170.00 for two people I expect everything to be top notch."
05/27/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The food was fantastic, as always!"
05/27/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We have been going here for my wife's birthday and our anniversary for 2 years now and I we get waited on by the same staff, very pleasant, make us feel great and the food is awesome!"
05/27/2012,bg8990,4.0,"Not my first time and food is consistently good. My husband's steak was very tasty and cooked just right. The service was excellent; friendly and informative. My only issue with this and most all steakhouses -- SMALLER STEAKS..PLEASE! I love a good strip, but 14 oz is just way too big for me. So I had to order the halibut in order not to waste food. It was firm, moist and delicious. I would recommend it as an alternative to those who don't want meat."
05/26/2012,LynetteC,4.0,We went for dinner prior to a show. We had reservations at 5:30. They seated us relitively on time. Food was OUTSTANDING. The Garlic bread with blue cheese fondu is a MUST ORDER. Only concern is it is very loud. Often difficult to hear server and even the people sitting at our table.
05/26/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"A bit pricey, but worth every cent! It was my first visit and I will 100% be going back!"
05/26/2012,JosephD,4.0,One of the best steaks I've ever eaten. Lobster mashed potatoes were amazing!
05/26/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Only drawback was we felt rushed in respect to the way the food was served. Appetizer came right away followed by dinner quickly after finishing it. Recommendation would be to enjoy drinks first, put app order in but wait a little bit for entree"
05/24/2012,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"My wife and I dined at MJ's at Mohegan Sun over this past Memorial Day weekend. We had been to the restaurant before and were very much looking forward to a great meal. We asked in advance for a quiet table and were given a very quiet booth at the rear of the restaurant so things started well. Appetizers were great - the garlic bread is a must! From there things started to spiral downward with an inattentive waitress, a very long wait for our steaks which were overcooked and needed to be sent back, to our final lasting frustration of having been charged for the replacement steaks and delayed while we waited for the bill to be reconciled. Next time, we plan to eat at the MJ sports cafe next door where you can get the same appetizers"
05/22/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,we love michael jordan's great steaks great martinis and great service always a pleasure
05/22/2012,JMCout4dinner,3.0,"I was revved up to eat here since someone had recommended it. I was dissappointed when I left The service leaves a lot to be desired. I eat at Old Homestead in Borgata, Safari House in Taj Majal and Redds in Mount Airy and they are heads above this steakhouse."
05/21/2012,LWJAN,3.0,"steaks were very small for the price i have been there many times and it seems that they have cut way back on many things. Servers were to the point of obnoxious on their upsell.

Probably wont recomend to anyone again. Would not visit again. Really to bad, we used to love this place."
05/21/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Very good overall. Service and atmosphere were excellent.
05/21/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Michael Jordan's was great. This was our 30th wedding anniversary and we really wanted to do it right and we were not disappointed. Knowing it was our 30th they gave us a very nice cozy quiet booth and an excellent waitress. Great Food too. We had a wonderful time.
05/20/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,One of the best Delmonico Steaks I have ever had.
05/20/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The steaks never disappoint and the cheesy bread is to die for. Also, the lobster mashed potatoes are great."
05/20/2012,OpenTable,2.0,"I took my boyfriend here as a surprise as he is a die hard baskebtall fan. It was very disappointing to see the restaurant part did not have one piece of basketball of any sort and was very dull. The food was very expensive and was not good at all, I left hungry. The service however by Leah was great though. I would not return or recommend."
05/19/2012,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"I thought the prices were extremely high. I don't mind paying high prices if the food is exceptional, which it was not - food was just ok. My suggestion to the restaurant, lower the prices a bit, fine tune your food and add a few more options to the menu. For a party of three the bill came to 300.00. The next night we feed a party of 9 at a much nicer restaurant for 405.00"
05/17/2012,JohnW,4.0,"This was my first trip to Michael Jordan's. I had heard good word of mouth with some recommended dishes, like the Wagyu beef (ordered by the ounce), the truffle fries, and garlic bread with fondue among others. Nothing disappointed food-wise and the food prices were reasonable for a steak house. The wines were a different story. The wine list was very good and representative, but the prices were higher than other steakhouses that I feel are better. Prices more than triple retail is a bit much. But while there may not be bargains on the wine list, there are some wines that are better values than others. Look for them. But I still think it is worth visiting if you are at the Casino. Whether I would make a trip just for dinner . . ."
05/17/2012,burgerguy,5.0,Service was excellent; wait staff very knowledgeable and helpful; food was very good. Had the bone in ribeye lobster mashed and the baked corn.
05/15/2012,dennism,3.0,"the steaks were below average.i have had steaks at outback steakhouse and at home,from shaws smkt.,that were SUPERIOR at a third of the cost. i SERIOUSLY DOUBT that your steaks our PRIME."
05/13/2012,Marge,3.0,"Very noisy venue and tables are on top of each other. There is no opportunity for a private conversation. The tables are situated for 4 by the windows so if you are a two, there is no opportunity for a quiter table there. Even though my reservation was made months in advance, I was still given a center table which meant I heard conversations on both sides."
05/12/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Excellent. Food, wine and service were flawless."
05/12/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellent meal....garlic bread w/ gorgonzola was outstanding & the filet cooked to perfection. Can't wait to return!
05/12/2012,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"It was very, very loud. To the point where we could not not have a normal conversation.
Our order was also wrong...twice."
05/07/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We very much enjoyed the total experience!
05/06/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Incredible service and food. Easily top 5 meal I have ever had.
05/05/2012,DomenicP,5.0,"Excellent meal! Scallops cooked to perfection, loved the presentation on the polenta. Can't wait to go back!"
05/04/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"listen to the servers, they know what they are suggesting; the crab cake is awesome!"
04/28/2012,OpenTable Diner,2.0,Arrived 5 minutes prior to our reservation. Took quite a long time to be seated. Wine list did not list vintages of most wines (somehow the Wine Spectator is OK with this). Food was adequate. Server got most of our order correct. Would have been nice to have had side dishes served at same time as steaks. Much too noisy to have a conversation at table. Experience was not on same level as other steak house chains like Morton's or Smith and Wollensky (but prices were).
04/28/2012,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"The restaurant was very crowded which I expected. What I don't like is that the table for two was quite small and we were seated too close to another couple at the next table. When I told the waiter it was our anniversary, he said he wished he knew earlier (he had just taken our order) because he would have brought us champagne. Don't tell me what you're not going to do for me!"
04/25/2012,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"If you want a great New York strip steak then this is the place. The food is excellent and the wait staff is very good, however the hostess up front had an unpleasant attitude but the rest of the night and food was good."
04/21/2012,Dianna,5.0,The food was excellent and so was the service
04/15/2012,pacmangolf,5.0,"We both had the wagu short ribs and loved them. That is now two times in a row where at least one of us had the short ribs. Like most other items here the meal was OUTSTANDING. The food here ALWAYS is!!! Pricey, but GREAT."
04/15/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The food was Wonderful. The service was great A little pricey,but the amount of food was crazy. More than we could eat"
04/13/2012,Erof,4.0,"We had a real nice time, the seafood is outstanding"
04/13/2012,JohnI,3.0,"The delmonico steak was a bit tough and the creamed spinach a bit salty. The martini order was not what we ordered - too much vermouth. We find Ruth Chris to be much better for the money - steaks are more tender, better selection in all categories, more private seating, less noise, etc."
04/08/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Good foood ,good drink. good service.
Not much more one could say.
Thank You MJ."
04/07/2012,Habits,1.0,I had the filet mignon and it was mediocre at best. Had to ask for all the sauces off but came out all sauced up and had to be redone. My wife's plate came out cold and the tuna itself was really cold (like refrigerator cold) and so touch you had to use a steak knife - this is not Ahi tuna!! Had to send it back and then the second time (this is after I finished eating mind you) the tuna was still tough and cold. We were ignored by the wait staff and also the hostesses when we tried to get there attention.
04/07/2012,Ninnafadinna,4.0,Try the Wagyu Beef short ribs--they literally melt in your mouth with flavor.
04/06/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Brian (our waiter) was very professional and helpful.
Our server (Ryan ) is always at his best.
It's always a pleasure to dine at Michel Jordans."
04/05/2012,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"The appetizers and side dishes were delicious, but the main dinner (porterhouse for two) was a huge and very expensive dissapointment. We love a great steak, but this lacked flavor. There was no sear to the outside of the porterhouse. The juice on the plate with the beef acted as a steamer for the steak, and caused it to have a pot roast kind of taste. The meat was also very tough. If you are a Ruths Chris fan, you will be dissapointed with this dish. Way overpriced at $96 dollars! We would not got back."
04/04/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,All 3 of us had Delmonico steak. It was 1/2 fat and half meat. The waitress said that kind of steak was like that. I usually order tenderloin so I was not aware. Otherwise everything else was wonderful. It is one of the best restaurants at Mohegan. The waitress came over several times and was very helpful.
03/31/2012,EvWK,3.0,The food was excellent. I would have preferred booth seating to make it more romantic.
03/31/2012,karemel,4.0,"Honestly, one of the few restaurants that is consistently a great place to eat."
03/31/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Everything was very nice especially our waitress Danielle. My husband has rib eye and I had Tuna steak. The steak was cooked perfectly, The beet salad was great. The wine and atmosphere was pleasant. Service was very good. Nice ambience."
03/31/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Our favorite go to restaurant for anything
03/30/2012,DocVox,5.0,"Once again we enjoyed Michael Jordan's at the Mohegan Sun. Being a Friday during Lent we ordered Scallops and Sea Bass, and both were excellent. The sauce with the Sea Bass was considered to be outstanding by my lady. Service was excellent by a friendly and efficient waitstaff. Our reservation details were carried out precisely, as usual, even though it was a busy night. This is definitely one of our very favorite dining venues on the East Coast."
03/30/2012,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"At Mohegan Sun you have several options for fine dining. We have been to Bobby Flay's Bar American and loved it. For the same price range we decided to try MJ's Steakhouse. What a misstake. The food was just ok. Nothing special or out of the ordinary like at Bobby Flays. When you pay $42 for just a steak you would expect something great but ours was just average with mine being nice and tender but my husbands was tough. Since everything was a la carte we paid an extra $9 for a salad (which was mixed greens, onion slices and 2 cut up grape tomatoes - for $9 couldn't they have added a little cucumber and maybe some gargonzola cheese to warrant charging $9? However I must say the house dressing was excellent and so was the warm rolls)."
03/30/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"This was one of the best meals I have ever had. Everything was prepared perfectly & tasted great. I had the arugula salad, bone in filet with home fries and creamed spinach. I am looking forward to returning to this location and/or trying their NY location."
03/29/2012,Afriged,5.0,PERFECTION IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE WAYS!
03/28/2012,mike,3.0,diner was good. We were disappointed with host for giving away our booth to others. why not give others a table when a booth was reserved for us. We eat diner at Jordan's every time we visit Mohegan. We made reservation to be at restaurant at 7 and the host should honor our request or tell us in advance we cannot be accomadated
03/27/2012,AnnieC,2.0,"Side dishes were too salty. I addressed the salty dishes to the waiter, he didn't seem to care."
03/24/2012,Linda,5.0,Love it food is the best here very pricy but worth it
03/18/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,fantastic steak!wow ! great food! pricey but worth it!
03/16/2012,Bearina,5.0,"We've tried all the other upscale restaurants at Mohegan Sun and saved this one purposely for last. Had a reservation. Prompt seating. Started with the best crab cake I've ever had - tender and light, full of crab and without fillers. My dining partner had the lobster bisque that was unlike any other - it had corn and chunks of lobster in a rich base. Had the special Chilean sea bass in a smokey tomato broth - super tender and flaky. The filet my husband had was different - he seemed to enjoy it. The sauce on top was not to my liking - but it was his meal. I really enjoyed mine! The waitress seemed to forget about us at the very end; we had to flag her down to take our payment."
03/12/2012,ToJoPo,5.0,Loved the restaurant. Had written on Open Table that it was my 20th anniversary and the restaurant gave us a little cake with a candle. Very sweet
03/11/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,The steaks were delicious and cooked as ordered.
03/10/2012,karemel,5.0,"Great food, drinks and service."
03/10/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,food and service was outstanding.
03/10/2012,TRdiningout,5.0,Everything was excellent- we highly recommend Michael Jordan's Steakhouse
03/10/2012,Aliekat24,4.0,Food is always excellent. Waiter was attentive. Only issue is the front desk. When you walk in many times are kept waiting either to give your name or to get to your table even though you have reservations. Once seated things are fantastic.
03/06/2012,LauraS,5.0,"This is our 6th or 7th birthday celebration at MJ's and as always, an excellent meal for a special occasion...outstanding service and a lovely evening."
03/06/2012,pacmangolf,5.0,"This is a solid restaurant that offers great tasting and well prepared beef. Tonight two of us had the fillet which was ordered and delivered medium rare...OUTSTANDING!!! Our other meal was wagu short ribs that were served with an outstanding sauce, my daughter said this is the best meal that she has had here. We shared two sides, asparagas and mac and cheese with pancetta & peas which were prepared wonderfully. The finishing course to this outstanding meal was a hot chocolate cake (as in molten lava) that was served with home made ice cream and glazed almonds. Once again we really enoyed ourselves, thanks"
03/03/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Highly recommend the Lobster Mashed Potatoes!
03/03/2012,Mark,4.0,Haven't been to MJ's in about a year and this time our meal was excellent. From the waitress to the food not a complaint. Everything wes up to par and worth every penny spent on a very good meal.
02/26/2012,CarolineD,3.0,"The food was excellant but the table we were given was terrible! I booked our reservation 2 weeks in advance and arrived 15 minutes early and we were placed at a table right in front of the main entrance so even with advanced planning we had the worst table in the restaurant and the hostess really did not seem to care at all, the wait staff was excellant though. Also we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated even though we had a reservation- once again, the hostess really did not care and the bar was so crowded we had to stand to drink our cocktail while we waited. A restaurant of this caliber (and price) I did expect better service and plannng on the part of the restaurant. It will be awhile before I consider going back"
02/26/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Food was delicious and the service was great! Prices were on the high side, but for a special occasion it was well worth it. Appetizers were phenomenal!! Would go back just for that! Garlic bread with blue cheese is a MUST TRY!
Excellent, as usual, and would definitely make plans to return."
02/25/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Great food good time, great service"
02/21/2012,Champ,5.0,The food was excellent. Enjoyed our dinner immensely.
02/20/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Dinners were delicious, but I was disappointed in the Double Smoked bacon appetizer. I had read other reviews saying it was good. I didn't understand what it actually was. So for those of you also in the dark, it is 2 long strips of canadian bacon, baked slightly, served with maple syrup. So, if you're not looking for ham, don't bother. Otherwise, service was perfect, was seated immediately (did have an early reservation on a Monday evening so most tables were empty when we arrived)and dinner was good enough to write about. What others have mentioned about price....It's true, you're talking $200. for two with a bottle of wine (no dessert), but for a special occasion, a really nice place to go and then walk off dinner."
02/20/2012,JohnW,5.0,"Everything was wonderful, super steaks and drinks, the sides were great!"
02/20/2012,OpenTable Diner,4.0,I was very pleased with the food and service.
02/19/2012,gene,5.0,"When I requested my reservation I asked as I usually do for a seat by the window. I arrives on time and had to wait. I tipped the hostess $5.00 , she thanked me and lateer I was Taken to a seat by a wall in the coener. I complained to the waitree and she was able to get me a better table. Not a nice way to treat regulars"
02/19/2012,DanM,5.0,"This was the second time we have been there my wife and I love the place. The only dissappointment was the fact that they highly reccommend the ""Garlic Bread"" as an appetizer and we were looking forward to having it, but they forgot to put the order in so we did not get it until the meal came out so we couldn't take our time and enjoy it. We would still love to go again....."
02/19/2012,loretta59,4.0,"Overall, very good however had to send prime rib back - too rare ordered well done. noticed table next to us sent theirs back as well.."
02/19/2012,KyleT,5.0,WENT FOR MY BOYFRIENDS BIRTHDAY AND SURPRISED HIM AND WE LOVED IT... DEFINITELY WILL VISIT AGAIN.. FOOD WAS DELICIOUS
02/18/2012,Ninnafadinna,4.0,Arugula salad and wagyu beef short ribs! Mmmmm good!
02/18/2012,Martin,5.0,Food was outstanding cooked to perfection
02/18/2012,KrystalG,5.0,We arrived for our reservation at 8:30 PM. The restaurant was busy and very energetic. After we were sat we were promptly greeted and had water brought to our table. For our appetizers we had the crab cake and garlic bread with blue cheese fondue. The crab cake was pure meat with hardly any filler and was divine. For our main courses I had Oscared Filet Mignon (medium) and my date ordered the bone in rib eye (medium rare). Our steaks were so succulent and done to perfection. For dessert we had coffee with cheesecake which also was delicious. My date said it was their best meal they ever had. It was truly a great night with fine dining. Will return!
02/18/2012,familiy5,5.0,"it was my first time and im sure wasnt the last, I had an outstanding experience. I went there a friday and today sunday i cant stop talking about the food, service and everything else. I will give them 10 stars if I could."
02/17/2012,Robss,4.0,Extremely crowded and noisy. Food was still excellent. Service was a little off due to crowd.
02/15/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"had an awesome time, and thank you for the little cake with the candle

we love it there and will be back as soon as we can"
02/15/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great ambiance and service will return.
02/15/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,My husband and I went here for Valentines Day and the food was excellent and I can't wait to go here again.
02/13/2012,OpenTable Diner,2.0,Food was ok. Service was horrible. Would not dine again here!!
02/12/2012,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"This place really isn't good. Not to say it's horrible or even bad, but certainly not worth the price or attention. Slow and not the most polished service. Under seasoned and bland tartare. Overcooked steak, flavorless polenta. Drinks were pricey and dessert did not impress. The best part was the sides. Macaroni and Cheese and MJ's Homefries are two things I would be happy to eat again. The rest not so much. Nothing was awful, everything was edible, but when I am paying around $200 for two, I expect much more. For that price, there are many far better options and flat out much better steak!"
02/12/2012,pacmangolf,5.0,"I hate having a reservation here and having to wait...ALL THE TIME...even when it is not busy. Having said that tonight it was busy and an 8pm reservation. We sat down at our table about 8:20pm even with that reservation. I sometimes think it is their way of selling more drinks. Tonight it was just busy. Laura our server was GREAT, when dining there ask for her by name, she is that good. We both had the Fillet med/rare, my wife had it oscar. Both done to perfection. I always compare my fillet that I order out to the Palm resturant and this is right up there with that...OUTSTANDING evening well paced and very relaxing once we sat down."
02/11/2012,chowingCT860,5.0,"One of the upscale restaurants at Mohegan Sun. A little pricey, but the food is fantastic, although we feel they serve different (lesser) quality food at the bar than in the dining room. The steak and tuna tartar were fantastic, and a big porterhouse was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Will be back for sure."
02/11/2012,Jojo,5.0,The staff was very professional and pleasant. The food was absolutely delicious. Our steaks were cooked perfectly as well as the lobster tails. My overall experience was awesome. We were celebrating my husband's birthday and I found it to be perfectly romantic.
02/11/2012,Mary,5.0,"Double smoked bacon appetizer is to die for. Every part of my meal was an exceptional experience - from the red beet and goat cheese salad, the fresh fish of the day (chilean sea bass) in a tomato broth, fresh cut french fries with truffles."
02/10/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Second time there. It was as good as the first time. Food and service was great.
02/10/2012,WesB,5.0,"We keep coming back to Jordan's because the food is terrific, the ambiance is just trendy enough without being overdone, and the service is truly outstanding. It's expensive enough to be a ""special occasion"" spot, but you aren't paying unnecessarily because it is worth every penny."
02/10/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Had a great dinner food was wonderful all prepared as requested.
02/04/2012,AnJ1027,5.0,Fabulous food... not outrageously priced. Great ambiance.
01/29/2012,StephanieP,4.0,"Food was good but a little pricy for what you get, especially the sides which were very good but overpriced."
01/29/2012,KennethS,5.0,If you go to Micheal Jordans and you like crabcakes you must have the one they serve. It is the best.
01/29/2012,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"So very, very loud. Ambiance needs to be nicer for the price. Table next to the waiter station was uncomfortable and felt crowded. Steaks were cooked perfectly. Very good service."
01/28/2012,LindaR,5.0,Michael Jordan's has never failed us. Although it is a bit pricey it is every bite worth it.
01/25/2012,josephmpalladino,4.0,Food and service on 1/24 as usual very good. They also took time to recognize my wife's birthday making it a special dining experience.
01/23/2012,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"I had gone to the MJ sportscafe right next door and found that to be a better find. The prices are doubled, and the food appeared to be about the same. I got a Filet Mignon from both locations and it was the same, just had different sides. The portions were large, but for the price I would say it would be better to go across the way. Also, when I was there, large crowds of loud people were there yelling and screaming."
01/22/2012,EllenT,2.0,Nothing more than an upscale pub with over priced food and drink
01/22/2012,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"We were disappointed with our visit. We have been to Michael Jordans quite a few times over the years and have always enjoyed our meal. The steak that my husband and I love and split as a meal is no longer on the menu, a disappointment. The steak we did order was cooked perfectly and tasted great but the sides we just ok. The lobster mashed potatoes were very dry and tasted old. My daughters lobster bisques was ok. Our favorite appetizer the garlic bluechese bread again was a disappointment. It lacked the blue cheese in the sauce and the sauce was scarce. Overall very dissappointed, not sure if we will return."
01/21/2012,AnalogKid,3.0,"This has always been a favorite of mine...until now.
Those who have enjoyed MJ's please note...the prices have gone up, and the steaks have gotten smaller. A few favorites have also been removed from the menu, like the Cowboy Steak.
The steaks still taste fantastic, but they appear to have also gone down in quality. The bone in ribeye was particularly fatty this time."
01/20/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,service was excellent. waiter was excellent and Matt came over to our table a few times to make sure everything was alright. Wonderful experience
01/20/2012,JeffreyB,5.0,Meal was so outstanding I went back the next night again
01/16/2012,Ravenswood,3.0,"This was at least our 6th time there and I must say, if it were our 1st time, I'm not sure I would go back. The size of my pomegranate martini left a lot to be desired once you consider the amount of 'foam' on top of it (don't know where that came from.)I always order the 8oz. filet mingon well done, and it was always done not only 'well' but still tender and juicy.....not this time.I asked that a glass of Merlot come with dinner. My steak came and I was about 1/3 of the way done before my wine came.....again disappointing.Again, I have always raved about our dinning experiences at Michael Jordan's, but if this had been our first visit, it probably would be our last."
01/15/2012,JohnP,3.0,"This has been a favorite of ours for quite awhile so we brought friends for dinner here. While the service was good, it was slow and there was a noticeable drop in the number of servers. The food was still excellent, however pricey, (but not any more so than any of the casino restaurants). We will be return customers but not as often as we have been previously. Bobby Flay's Bar American is a better restaurant in our opinion."
01/15/2012,Laura,3.0,"I've eaten at MJ's several times and my food was always perfect. However, sat. Night the steak was overdone and hard to chew."
01/14/2012,FlipFlop,4.0,"We arrived at the time of our reservation and was seated promptly towards the back of the resturant. The garlic bread was decadent, the salads very good and the steaks excellent - pricey but expected at this location. Our server seemed to have tables scattered around the resturant so we didn't see her often. The tables were placed very closely and a large man at the table next to us kept hitting my 80-year old mother's chair so we move the table ourselves."
01/14/2012,GayleH,5.0,"This was a wonderful dinner, some of the best steaks we have had in all of our travels! The food was served pefectly, cooked PERFECTLY (Medium rare was PERFECT, as was a medium well for my husband) and the desserts were out of this world. Loved the very private booth 4 of us at dinner) with floor to ceiling walls...it was a delightful dinner experience!"
01/14/2012,JerryM,5.0,Great food and service. Would recommend to anyone.
01/14/2012,JoeU,4.0,Food was excellent. Service was very good and the location of our table was in a quiet place in the restaurant. Couldnt ask for a better time.
01/14/2012,Doozer82,5.0,"We dined here years ago (maybe 10) and said we'd never come back because of how expensive it was and our steaks were not good. My Filet was grisly, and that should never happen. I am hoping, after visiting again and having a great experience, that the visit years ago was the exception. This last visit was great. Carrie, our server, was attentive and personable, and our steaks were all done as ordered and were very tasty. The sides were good as well."
01/08/2012,DavidP,5.0,"The service-outstanding,ambiance-perfection & food-a definite 5 star restaurant. We went on Prime rib Sunday & the cut is smaller but that's what you want when you start with the shrimp cocktail & crab cake because they are exceptional. Then your rib dinner comes with a ceasar salad, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach (sides are enough for 2 people) & dessert of apple cobbler. I got the filet mignon special,cooked to perfection as always & just melted in your mouth. And even the special came with fingerling potatoes & duck apring rolls. But I had to have a salad and the wonderful lobster mashed potatoes too. EXCELLENT. I tried a sparkling wine that was wonderful (wish I could remember the name)Top it off with Italian coffee..EXCELLENT!!!!!!!"
01/08/2012,MarkA,4.0,"The one and only issue with Michael Jordan's Steakhouse at Mohegan Sun is the ambiance. For the price you pay (plan on it being around $100/person or more), it should be much quieter for the people that want a nice intimate setting. Other than that, the food and service was outstanding."
01/08/2012,CSRicci,4.0,"A little noisy for a romantic dinner for two and a bit too chilly even with a long sleeve shirt, but fab food and great service."
01/07/2012,JimmyM,3.0,"I've been to Jordans many many times. The food seems not as good as use to be. Garlic bread was good, but not as good as before. The salad was very good. My son and i had the Porterhouse for two. I ordered it medrare the strip was done perfect the filet part was torched and over cooked. Ice cold plates to eat your entree on, not good. The baked potato was under cooked and hard inside. Service was excellent!! The cheese cake was awesome. Thank goodness had enough points on my card to pay for the meal or i would have been totally disapointed. In the future i will go to Ruth Chris's or Carmine Anthony's."
01/07/2012,TimD,5.0,"The food was un-real.
Great job!!"
01/07/2012,KPK21,5.0,MJ's is always great. I eat at either MJ's Cafe 23 or MJ's Fine dinning atleast 3-4 times a month.
01/07/2012,GAMESWHIZ,5.0,"MJ's is an upscale restaurant in a casino setting. We've eaten here several times and the service and food is very good. I always get the filet mignon, cooked well done and have never been disappointed. The baked potato is enough to share as are the side orders of vegetables. Other family members love the garlic bread which sits atop blue cheese fondue. A nice place to go for that special occasion."
01/06/2012,OpenTable Diner,2.0,The steak was very expensive and wasn't cooked the way we liked it. After arguing with the waitress they brought us new steaks but at that point its kind of too late. I have eaten there before and I loved it this time I brought my girl friend and I was very dissapointed!
01/06/2012,alwayslookin4excellent,5.0,food and service were excellent. the most uncomfortable chairs i have ever sat in......
01/01/2012,TianaW,5.0,"Went with friends for NYE. We were lucky to get a reservation because they were over booked. The place was JUMPING, but the staff was super accommodating. Complementary champagne for the midnight toast. The food was amazing, and I highly recommend the ""sugar plum"" cocktail."
01/01/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Our server was excellent, I wish I could remember his name but he made our experience a memorable one."
01/01/2012,Allaboutthefood,4.0,"With dark wood and leather chairs, the dining room is warm and inviting. The steaks have never disappointed but the lobster risotto was bland and boring. I really wanted it but would pass when going again. The corn off the cob was the bomb! Although my steak was not as I'd ordered (got the reduction instead of the au poivre), it was still excellent but kinda rubbed me the wrong way that the server was not willing to fix it. The signature blue cheese bread can't be passed up."
01/01/2012,travellotta1,5.0,Very nice! Steaks were cooked exactly right. Entrees were large enought for
01/01/2012,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Great dinner, especially on a busy New Years Eve! Service was great and food was very good and hot!"
12/31/2011,JenniferH,4.0,"Amazing food, steaks are melt in your mouth delicious highly recommend for any special occasion ."
12/31/2011,FrankieM,4.0,"Good environment, good food, good service, good drinks."
12/31/2011,RosemaryD,5.0,"We went New Year's Eve, not the best night to try a new restaurant; but it was great. Our server was very attentive, even brought out a ""shout"" wipe for my friend when she spilled something on her white blouse! Can't say anything bad about the meal; would definitely go back."
12/31/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food and service were amazing!! Their signature garlic bread served with bleu cheese fondue is to die for! I ate the Delmonico steak...fabulous. It was so tender that I probably could have used a butter knife. The booth was a u shape and had high walls to the ceiling covered in a red velvet and toss pillows throw on the seats! Very romantic for me and my husband! Cocktails and wine topped it off! Would definitely eat here again!
12/30/2011,marnib,4.0,always delish....best creamed spinach around!
12/30/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"For the price points on our dinner I prefer either Fleming's or Ruth Chris Steakhouse
But I have to admit our Beet salads where outstanding :)"
12/30/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"outstanding dinner. Table was ready per our reservation. Food and service were over the top. I mentioned a birthday at our table, sure enough you surprised us with a free dessert with candle, not expecting that. Super evening, will visit again and recommend to all."
12/30/2011,RansomL,2.0,Truly dreadful service. Had better at a school cafeteria. Would never go back particularly since the food is forgettable and over-priced to boot!
12/30/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Very expensive but the food was prepared wellband tasted great but again very expensive
12/29/2011,Thanksgiving2023,2.0,"We have been to Michael Jordan's Steakhouse several times. Our most recent experience was very good, but this visit was definitely off. We had Kansas City Strips (Prime) that were actually tough, and the overall meal took much too long to complete."
12/29/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,the rib-eye and and short ribs couuld not have been betterj
12/29/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Good steaks, knowledgeable wait staff but not doting. Decent wine list with some good values. I would recommend the tuna roll appetizer. Exceptional quality tuna. Overall a typical steak place; good, too expensive."
12/25/2011,yummyeats,5.0,First off I have to this was the most enjoyable meal I had in a while. Food was very good! We had a group of 4 and everyone agreed. I had the lamb chop cooked to medium which was very flavorful and not gamey at all. The other 3 parties all ordered steak. My husband ordered the bone-in filet mignon which he shared pieces with. Our party agreed it was the most tender piece of steak that we ever had. For app. we started with the garlic bread with blue cheese fondue which was pretty good. For sides we had the lobster mashed potatoes and sautéed onions and mushrooms in truffle oil. The mashed potatoes I thought was just ok. The mushrooms I liked though. We were seated in a very cozy booth which made dining experience even better. We'll be back!!
12/25/2011,WayneJ,5.0,"With family scattered for Christmas day, my wife and I chose Michael Jordan's for dinner based on prior experience and the fact that they were open for the day. The special, wild boar, was a first for us and perfectly done with delicious accompaniments.... sweet potato puree and huckleberry preserves. In spite of the holiday, service was prompt and attentive. There is a good selection of wines at all price points."
12/25/2011,KayN,4.0,"For a very good to great meal, Michael Jordan's is the place. One of the best, if not best restaurant in Mohegan Sun. Most of the eating establishments are mediocre at best, or fast food. Not only a steakhouse but has seafood and other meat/poultry dishes. Good portions and knowledgeable staff. One of only 2 I would consider when at Mohegan Sun."
12/24/2011,CafeDame,4.0,Entrees were great ---- desserts eg baked Alaska and peanut butter kit kat bars were really really inedible .... Drinks were great --- just avoid desserts --- really you would think that they would have shined --- too bad for $250
12/24/2011,Capone,5.0,"If you like steak, its the place to be. Three of us each had the bone-in filet mignon. We each asked for it to be prepared differently; all were excellent. The service was fantastic and even the chef helped deilver our entrees."
12/24/2011,Dave,4.0,Too expensive for the portion sizes.
12/18/2011,shelby614,2.0,service excellent! food very average at extremely above average prices atmosphere seemed very 1960's decor. Have to be honest and say I live in New Haven CT so its very hard to beat the neighborhood food and prices . (Wooster St)
12/17/2011,Char,5.0,We enjoyed our evening at MJ's. The meal was delicious as well as the service.We decided to get a gift receipt for our Son and his wife!!!!!
12/11/2011,Susan,5.0,We had a great time at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse. Our waiter was excellent and met all of our needs. The food was excellent and they had a great selection. I would recommend this restaurant for any occasion.
12/10/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The staff was great. The food was pricey, but it is considered ""fine dinning"". Is was a great experience."
12/10/2011,RobertR,2.0,"This restaurant had been recommended by an associate. Although the steak was very good, The ""MJ"" potatoes were terrible! When asked about how these potatoes were prepared, the waiter indicated that they were much like lyonnaise{sp?}potatoes.These were huge chunks of potatoes that were unappealing in appearance, dried by however they were prepared, and without a good flavor. The onions were so scarce that it would be hard to evaluate them. Overall, the restaurant did nothing to justify the incredibly high prices charged for a very mediocre dining experience. We would not return to this restaurant."
12/04/2011,foodie232,5.0,"great food, great service, this is exactly what a fine dining restaurant should be."
12/04/2011,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Food expensive and not fantastic
12/03/2011,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"My filet Mignon steak was not steakhouse quality, at Medium it was dry Certainly not of the quality expected,"
12/03/2011,Vicky,5.0,This second visit in three weeks was just as spectacular! Take it from someone who does not enjoy beef... the entrees are phenomenal. I asked my husband to take me to Michael Jordan's again so soon because I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. This is the first time ever that I asked to go to a steak house for dinner. It is a wonderful treat... already looking forward to the next visit!!!
11/27/2011,JeanH,4.0,The Sunday Night Family Prime Rib Dinner is well worth a visit if you're in the area.
11/27/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,My wife and I had a great dining experience. Our service was great. Fast attentive and made great suggestions.
11/26/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellent again...no draft this time

11/26/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Food is always outstanding and the selections are awesome. Always look forward to a special dinner here.
11/25/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"First time @ this restaurant, food, drinks atmosphere and service were excellent. Would recommend to others."
11/20/2011,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Service was great, so were the arugula salad and sautéed onions and mushrooms. We were a little disappointed in the porterhouse for 2. We have had porterhouses in other restaurants, for less than $92.00, that melt in your mouth. The seasoning was a bit overpowering and the meat not as tender as we would've liked. We expected a melt in your mouth steak- not what we got. It was just ""okay""."
11/20/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Absolutely delicous! My husband and I have been raving about our visit!! It was more expensive than we typically spend, however it was a special occasion and we were very satisified with our entire experience! We will and have been recommending the restaurant and hopefully we will be able to return again!!"
11/20/2011,KennethB,3.0,They changed the menu. It was not as good as previous times. They took away the lamb chops which was their best dish
11/20/2011,Paris0908,3.0,"The food is very good, but be prepared to wait even if you have a reservation."
11/19/2011,Rich,5.0,steak and chicken outstanding. Service upbeat and General Manager Casey Reid very pleasant coming by to visit the table and say hello.

11/18/2011,KingstonMike,5.0,"Great meal once again. We had the Delmonico and NY Strip, both were fantastic and cant wait to eat there again."
11/18/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Awesome Restaurant. Run like a gem full of pride. Steaks were awesome. Would love to go again. Service was incredible.
11/18/2011,JerryL,2.0,We were looking for a nice dinner out and found it to be extremely noisy. One steak was great the other overdone. Next time we will make a different dining choice.
11/17/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We felt the selection of music that night was too casual for the elegant ambience of the restaurant. It would have been apprpopreate for the sports bar.
11/13/2011,FireHouseGirl,3.0,"The salmon that I had was excellent. The Delmonico Steak my friend had was very fatty and more rare than medium. The salads we had, a garden and ceasar salad which were good. The potatoes were very good in taste. We each had a serving, one had the Lobster & the other the mashed. The waiter should of explained to us that the sides can feed two people very easily, instead of wasting the food. We felt like we were ignored at times, we had to flag down our waiter at least 3 times. It is not dicouraging me from coming back, I'm just hoping it was just an off night for the cooks & wait staff."
11/13/2011,robertg,5.0,"I have been to jordans steakhouse on a few occassions. Everytime I leave there just raving about how great the food and atmosphere is there. I just can't wait to plan next trip to casino.
Excellent job to all involved in making it happen."
11/13/2011,SandraS,5.0,This was our second visit to the restaurant while staying at Mohegan Sun Casino in Connecticut. My husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary there this weekend and it was great. The staff was wonderful and friendly. They surprised me with my gifts from my husband and dessert was on the house.
11/13/2011,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"The filet was fatty and tough, the sides are overpriced, the restaurant was noisy, and service was ok. I would not recommend this restaurant unless you like to over pay for mediocre food."
11/12/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Great steaks, great service. A bit pricey but worth it!"
11/12/2011,Vicky,5.0,"Everything we hoped for and more! When you are entertaining another couple at a restaurant you don't know at all, it's pleasant to have your reservation acknowledged and confirmed for a fabulous evening without the worry!!!"
11/12/2011,DanielR,5.0,Once again we were not disappointed with the service and food at Michael Jordans Steakhouse. Thanks for an enjoyable experience!!!
11/12/2011,NYFoodie,5.0,"Service wasn't as good as usual this night. Waitress made us wait too long between orders for appetizers, and entrees. Also didn't return to our table at any point to ask the usual, ""Is everything ok, can I get you anything?"" She also didn't pour the wine, or the sparling water...I guess it depends who serves you here?  Food was awesome as always, ambiance awesome as always."
11/07/2011,JanetD,4.0,We had a wonderful waitress who explained the specials of the evening and gave us just enough time between courses. It was for a special occasion and our guest was very impressed and would definately go back.

11/04/2011,BobH,5.0,"There aren't a lot of options at the Mohegan Sun, but the food is great, the service was very attentive and we had a nice time. My only criticism is that it is very expensive and and even for a high end steakhouse,over priced, but when you are locked into the casino you don't have a lot of optionsd and they take advantage of it. There were four of us and we ended up over $300 and we only purchased 2 drinks at the table total and had no dessert."
11/04/2011,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"The service was wonderful. Our server was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about the menu and wine list. The steak was excellent as well, and my husband actually had the opportunity to speak with the chef regarding the different cuts of meat before ordering. The scallops were OK, nothing to write home about and the lobster mashed potatoes were not even close to as good as we'd anticipated. The wine was great, though, which always helps. And our appetizer (we got the ahi tuna) and bread before dinner were yummy as well. Overall, it was over-priced but we knew that going in and you can't expect reasonable prices at the casino anyway! Overall, we thought it was good, but not as stellar as we'd hoped."
11/04/2011,MarlC,5.0,"The best Cesar salad we've had in years, and the steak was divine. It was a Saturday night so it was very busy, and very noisy. It's expensive, but well worth it."
11/04/2011,MarieH,5.0,The ribeye steak was incredible! And we had never had such delicious garlic bread until we tasted the garlic break with blue cheese on the menu!
11/03/2011,Jillanne23,5.0,"It's one of my favorites thought the Lobsters mashed potatoes were over cooke, everything else great. THe service was fantastic!!!!!!!"
11/01/2011,Wintergirl,5.0,"Great Food, but expensive, not for budget minded. On the scale of The Palm."
10/30/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The steaks were amazing. We have been there several times and have not had a bad experience. Try the roasted corn when you are there. One dish is enough to fede the entire table. The rolls are melt in your mouth and if you have room for dessert you will not be disappointed.
10/29/2011,Coffee2go,5.0,"Hostesses and waiters, wonderful! Food was great!!!Would highly recommend!!!"
10/29/2011,JimM,5.0,Best steaks we've had in a long time!
10/29/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great from start to finish. The staff was wonderful.
10/29/2011,Liz2,4.0,Very enjoyable dining experience.
10/28/2011,SteveK,3.0,We had the porterhouse for 2. Quite honestly it does not match up in size or flavor to the porterhouses at Ruth's Chris or the Palm. The hand cut steak fries and the corn sides were very good. Wish we tried. Bar americain instead.
10/27/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"this is the only restaurant that my 94 year old father will eat meat . he loves the filet mignon, it melts in his mouth."
10/23/2011,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"service was very, very slow.the waiter seemed overwhelmed and it wasnt extremely busy. we were not even approached for 15 minutes afer we were seated and didnt get our rolls for 35 minutes after we were seated. food was good but service was horrible."
10/23/2011,Ravenswood,5.0,"Michael Jordon's is the only place I will order fillet, as I like it well done, and cannot believe how tender it is. Also, would really like to see the white truffle potato salad that comes under it, as a full portion side dish(I take tiny bites to make it last.)The arugula salad is amazing too. I guess I really should try something different next time but why mess with perfection? My husband usually has the Sunday $25.00 Prime Rib Dinner special...always perfect! And the blue cheese garlic bread....OMG!!"
10/23/2011,ChefT,4.0,"The food and service were top notch, but we did have a reservation and ended getting seated 20 minutes after our reservation time.....We felt the hostess was not too friendly and was put off by us asking when were going to be seated. Not a great first impression."
10/22/2011,Froggy,5.0,Superb meal...the quality of the steaks has improved...
10/22/2011,rjt55,4.0,great food as always. friendly and courteous service even though extremely busy Saturday night.
10/22/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great food and restaurant. Had a great time on my 60th birthday. thank you.
10/22/2011,AwesomeEsq,4.0,"Food was very good, but we went when there was a concert at the hotel and the restaurant and bar were packed.  It was very loud & felt very rushed.  Service was just average, nothing special"
10/22/2011,Robss,5.0,Excellent food.Service was outstanding. Waitress and busgirl were the best i ever had (forgot their names). Great personalities. Manager came over and checked on table (nice touch). Will eat here as often as I can.
10/21/2011,NancyZ,5.0,"My husband and I had the proterhouse for 2, and it was outstanding! And we always order the garlic bread! We eat at Michael Jordans whever we visit Mohegan Sun."
10/16/2011,Cathy,4.0,"Had dinner here with two other ladies. Our server was Liz, she was excellent. The food was great, be sure to try the garlic bread, it's the best!"
10/15/2011,RosemarieW,5.0,"We had a fantastic experience at Michael Jordan's. The staff was friendly and accommodating.

We started off with their garlic breadsticks (they were awesome), then I had the seared scallops (just yummy), my husband had a melt-in-your mouth filet mignon (the best he's had anywhere)!

It is obvious from the demeanor of the staff and the presentation of the food that this restaurant strives to be one of the best! AND it is!!

Would go again!!"
10/14/2011,GregoryG,5.0,"We were late for our reservation as the couple we were meeting got caught in some bad weather and traffic. The front desk staff was very gracious and seated us when our party arrived. The food, although pricey, was delicious. This was our second visit to MJ's and we would definitely return."
10/14/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Always a guaranteed great steak!
10/14/2011,number1,5.0,always dependably great!NEVER been disappointed
10/14/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Excellant food , great atmosphere . No other place to get a great Steak ."
10/14/2011,AudO,4.0,Our waiter got his jollies out of criticizing the other restaurants in the area. He claimed that Michael Jordan's was the only one to retain their own people and not let them go for less quality servers as the other restaurants have. He was in bad form criticizing the other restaurants.
10/09/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. We had a great time! The food was great, the staff was friendly, the ambiance was great and would love to go back the next time I am at Mohegan Sun!"
10/09/2011,HollyY,5.0,"The food and service were excellent and we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. The vegetable selection (roasted brussel sprouts) was superb. I think the cost is high and normally I wouldn't choose this type of restaurant for a regular meal but the occasion was a special treat for me and my dining partner. All in all, the dining experience was wonderful."
10/09/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,I don't need to say more
10/09/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Overall it was good, the food is great, but it is a bit noisy in there, you almost have to yell to the person your sitting next too."
10/08/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Fantastic food. Great atmosphere. Wonderful staff. A totally enjoyable experience. Can't wait to do it again.
10/08/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Outstanding! The best dinner out I have had in a while. The house Cabernet wine was excellent. The filet mignon was amazing. The garlic bread was filling and delicious and not like any other garlic bread I have had. And the garden salad had just the right ammount of dressing tossed in - not to wet not to dry. Finished with a coffee and choc molten cake that was one of the best I have had. You will not be disappointed.
10/06/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,excellent! Booth was all set up as we requested. Special event was remembered with a special candle decorated desert. Steak was outstanding. Consistent high marks!
10/06/2011,DonnaC,5.0,Very Pricey but delicious for a 1x year special occassion. Suggest sharing entree to make room for Baked Alaska!
10/02/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,We had a very good dinner and would return another time.
10/02/2011,Foodie,5.0,"Great spot.  Pleased to see they enforce the no hats allowed attire.   Because this restuarant is located in the Mohegan Sun Casino, the clientel doesn't always dress to the level that Michael Jordan's deserves.  It was good to see the restaurant management turn away customers who don't meet the proper attire."
10/01/2011,Mpleon99,4.0,I have eaten at Michael Jordans several times. The food was not quite as good as previous visits. The service was also not what I had been used to.
10/01/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food was excellent. I had a filet mignon that was cooked perfectly. The sides were very good portions. I would definately dine there again.
10/01/2011,pacmangolf,3.0,"First let me say that the food is OUTSTANDING here, I sometimes wonder weather it is worth it when you have to put up with all the ""other stuff"" that is present here. First off the coporate culture of having a reservation and always being told you have to wait is getting very tired, especially when you can see many open tables. I AM NOT GOING TO THE BAR AND BUYING A DRINK BECAUSE YOU TELL ME I HAVE TO WAIT. Instead, maybe I just won't come back. Secondly, I have noticed that waitstaff attitude changes for the worst if we are not drinking (maybe the lower tab has something to do with this). Saturday the food was GREAT but the service that Monica gave us was SUBSTANDARD! With many other choices here, unless this changes I will try them."
10/01/2011,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Extremely noisey, and temperture in restaurant was uncomfortably cold. Steak was good, tuna was excellent."
09/30/2011,Chris,3.0,"The service and drinks were great, but the steaks were just alright. Especially for the price. The delmonico /ribeye was thin cut and therefore a bit dry. Skirt steak lacked major flavor. I would rate food as good overll, fair for those prices... It is not quite a NY steakhouse. Although prices are similar. Service was overall ezcellwnt, as was atmosphere too."
09/28/2011,rosie,4.0,"This restaurant never fails to please. The food is great, the rack of Lamb was perfect. My husband who always has a steak there is never dissapointed. We share the beet salad and love it. The staff is very professional and the service all around is flawless. It's the best restaurant in Mohegan"
09/26/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We went for a Surprise birthday dinner and it was perfect! The table and dining room was roomie, the servers attentive and the drinks and food flowed. Great spot for a get to gather. You really don't feel like your laughter and fun are overlapping other peoples good time."
09/24/2011,Megan,5.0,The wait staff and host/hostest could not have been nicer. Everyone greeted us with such smiles and a true sense of service. The waiter had recommendation on food choices and was knowledgable about the food that was being served. Very Very Impressive. It is not a Johnny Rocket so don't expect to get out with out a pricy bill but if you are looking for a grown up place to eat with wonderful food - then Michael Jordan's is the place to eat!
09/24/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Filet was awesome, bleu cheese fondue with garlic bread was amazing, Yukon mashed and mac n cheese sides were super good"
09/18/2011,Danielk,3.0,"Food was good, the wine list was overpriced, the noise in the place made it hard to talk
to someone that was sitting 2 spots away from you."
09/18/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The food was outstanding as always. We are never disappointed with anything we order off of the Michael Jordan's menu. We have been to the restaurant several times and unfortunately, we had poor service this visit. Our waitress was hardly available and we were tended to only by a bus boy when we called him over. We had to ask our waitress, Liz, three separate times to simply bring bread to the table. She still received a very generous tip (because it's just easier to round up...) but her total lack of concern and apathetic attitude certainly rubbed us the wrong way. Thankfully, the food was incredible so we made the best of the evening!"
09/17/2011,gardenlady,3.0,This restaurant is extremely over priced and noisy. We want to get away from casino noise when dining there so this was not a good choice for us. Food was good but again was very overpriced.
09/17/2011,JessicaW,4.0,Our server was great to recommend a wonderful bottle of wine in our price range but was otherwise fairly absent. The sides were incredible and my steak was ok. I don't know if it was worth $40. It was a great evening though.
09/16/2011,Grandmasandy,5.0,loved it as usual steak cooked just the way i liked it.
09/16/2011,ROBERTM,2.0,the food quality isnt good enough here for how much it costs to eat here.
09/16/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Food was great; chose from the Restaurant week menu plus the garlic bread and great cocktails. Mussels were delicious ,steak perfect and right size desert"
09/15/2011,DocVox,4.0,"We always can count on an excellent meal at Michael Jordan's at the Mohegan Sun. The filet mignon was almost tender enough to cut with a fork. Good selection of appetizers and deserts.
excellent mixologists, even to making a Virgin Mojito!
We have never been disappointed when using our Open Table reservation . . . even to the delivery of roses for the lady being on the table of our booth. Front of the house young ladies are pleasant and efficient . . . It is one of our favorites in our travels."
09/15/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"When I first walked up to the restaurant I said....... What the heck does MJ know about food. I went to another restaurant and had apps. They other place was nasty so I decoded to give MJ's a try. OMG was I wrong. Either MJ is a food expert or an expert in keeping good people working for him..... Either way I don't care. I went here two nights in a row because the meal was simply the best I have had in years. The steaks are awesome the fish is incredible and the seafood tower rocks. The wine list was just ok, but I'm kinda a wine snob. Don't think basketball when you think about this place. Think incredible culanary experience. WOW"
09/14/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,The Filet were outstanding with peppercorn sauce and the cauliflower were also outstanding
09/10/2011,Qbano,3.0,I was told to order the KC steak but should've gone with the Porterhouse
09/09/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"In the many times we have eaten there, we always get the same thing .. STEAK.. can't be beat.. This time I had a Dark and Stormy drink which was great... haven't had one since Bermuda...."
09/04/2011,loretta59,5.0,"Food was excellant. Offered a family sytle Prime Rib Sunday dinner - plenty for 3 people..Waitress was also excellent. Very accomadating as my mom needs her meat extremely well done and althoiugh it did go back twice, the chef prepared a new dinner which was cooked to her satisfaction."
09/03/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,I have been to Michael Jordan's a few times and it's a great time and the food was great but this last time I went I tried a different steak and it was absolutely amazing!!! So tasteful and tender. I am telling everyone about it. It was my husbands first time there and he said it was worth every penny and more. We'll be back soon!
09/02/2011,NancyO,2.0,Food was good. Very noisy. Waiter was very inattentive. Had to ask for salt and pepper from bus person.
09/02/2011,DebraP,5.0,This was our first time and we loved everything about our dining experience!
09/02/2011,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Very upscale restaurant with an active dinner hour. Food selections are generally good. Outstanding soups, salads and appetizers. All servers are professionals who take pleasure in making your meal a memorable experience."
08/21/2011,ShannonL,5.0,"The Prime Rib special was outstanding! I have never had a better piece of prime rib. The amount of food we got for the $25 special price was unbelievable. I wish we knew about this special sooner in the month, because we would have come before then."
08/21/2011,CraigS,4.0,"Had the prime rib special on Sunday. Price was good, prime rib was OK. Service was excellent."
08/20/2011,DocVox,5.0,Through the years When we are at the Mohegan Sun we always plan an evening at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse. With reservations there is usually no or little wait if you arrive on time. Although it was packed on our last visit the service was still excellent and we have never had a bad or sub-par meal in the many years we have been customers. If there is an event in the Mohegan Arena expect MJ's to be crowded. but with reservations you will be OK.
08/20/2011,pacmangolf,5.0,"When at the Sun a stop at Michael Jordans is a must. Very very busy night with a 730pm reservation, got there a few minutes early and had to wait a few minutes but not bad, we had requested a server but she was tied up with two big parties and were ""handed off"" to Mike. OUTSTANDING server as we never felt rushed and he made a few great recomendations on the menu. The most outstanding being the special that my wife had veal short rib and balcked seas scallops which were great as detailed by not having anything left on the plate when she was done. I went with the scallops served over polenta...I know this gets old, but OUTSTANDING as well. Portions were very good size and we had no room for desert. Get second night at the Sun, thanks"
08/20/2011,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"We made a mistake choosing a Saturday night when the restaurant was full. The noise level was almost painful (the waiter had to bend over to us to be heard; tableside conversation was very difficult).
Generally the appetizers, salads and desserts were quite enjoyable. Their signature steaks were off the mark. The 'Kansas City' was tough , had too much grizzle and bone (1/3), and lacked in taste. The 'Delmonico' was more tender. Both were poor for prime aged beef."
08/20/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Everything that we had were great. From my Delmonico to my friend's New York Strip. MJ's know how to make a steak. Just be warned, make sure to have a reservation."
08/20/2011,NYFoodie,5.0,"A pleasure to eat here whenever we are nearby. Ambiance is awesome, food is great, service always exceptional."
08/19/2011,Bostoncouple1,5.0,Was surprised at how good this restaurant was. We had the Ahi Tuna Tartare followed by the leg of lamb. It was all perfect. Better than anything we had in Vegas last month. A must go to if you are at the casino!
08/19/2011,lovestotravel,4.0,"We each ordered a glass of wine (nice selection) and had the garlic bread and feta fondue for an appetizer. Yummy. For dinner we ordered one of the steak specials. The meat was cooked exactly as we asked and was very good. The green beans were crisp and the potato cakes were seasoned nicely. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and the waitress brought us a mini-cake (she said it's a small version of their 23 layer cake) that was to die for, LOL. Service was excellent. It's pricey, but for a special occasion, a very nice night out."
08/16/2011,Pops,4.0,The veal chop was excellent. Highly recommended. The service was fast paced - well suited for a restaurant in a casino.
08/16/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"MJ's does a fantastic job of bringing upscale delicious gourmet food without the stuffines of an upscale restaurant.

To start we had the toasted garlic bread served with blue cheese that was delicious. For the main course we both had the filet mignon, cooked stunningly perfect with a sweet mouthwatering demiglaze served over a bed of gourmet truffle infused potato salad. We also shared a side of the best mac n cheese onthe planet hands down. The baked Mac n cheese carbonara was cooked with delicious creamy cheese, peas and topped with perfectly toasted bread crumbs. The meal was second to none.
Overall mj's is a top notch restaurant. And the filet and the mac n cheese is the best I've had in my life. A great special occasion restaurant!"
08/15/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,WAITER AND WAITRESS GREAT. VERY ATTENTIVE...FOOD DELICIOUS...HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE SHARING A SPECIAL DAY.
08/14/2011,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Overal1 a pretty good experience. Waited to be seated about 20 minutes with reservations. Waited at the bar and had three different martinis. Could use some help with those recipes. Service was great all around but food was merely average. Wanted it to be better. Except the garlic bread! Best I have EVER had!
08/14/2011,Redhds,3.0,"We went to MJ to celebrate my son's 27th birthday and his finance's new job. Way too pricey for the atmosphere and food. Wait staff was only ho hum, doing a job. No intention of returning."
08/14/2011,GR8FUD,5.0,"I picked this restaurant to celebrate by boyfriends birthday. It was nice and romantic. The food and service was great. We had a nice cozy both big enough for a party of 5 for just the two of us. Be sure to have the garlic bread as an appetizer and the grilled corn off the cob as a side, it was Fantastic. The comp chocolate cake is great as well."
08/13/2011,Bill,5.0,Really liked our rack of lamb and the Kansas city steak. Caesar salads were a nothing special... but the garlic bread with a blue cheese fondue was great. My wife HATES blue cheese but really like the bread dish!
08/13/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The meal was delicious, steaks were superb. My mom had a veal chop to die for, prepared perfectly. Two of our side orders were cool, as if they were sitting under a warming light for a spell. The menu mimicked Morton's not very original but, very good. The service from the kitchen was slow especially since we ate early and it was not crowded when we arrived. The waiters and waitresses were very attentive and most delightful. The restaurant has a cold feel about it, not warm and comfy, very manly."
08/13/2011,ChrisC,5.0,"Great food, great service. The garlic bread is fantastic."
08/13/2011,SteveD,4.0,"I had the larger of the filet mignons, which was exquisite. It was served over potato salad which was lost next to the flavor of the meat and its sauce. The ahi tuna tempura appetizer was also delightful - the size of the pieces in the roll was wonderfully large. We also had the beet salad, home fries and lobster mashed potatoes all of which were terrific."
08/10/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,This was a special occasion for my Grandson’s 21st birthday and every thing went according to plan. The staff was excellent and the food was above average. Our grandson was very taken by the food and the attention that was given to our table.
08/07/2011,EllenT,2.0,"was seated in a spot right outside the kitchen when asked to change seat we were told they had no server for that table not 2 minutes passed and someone (not us) was seated at that quieter table. I just don't get the seating rules!!! My halibut was overcooked
to me there is no reason in a 5 star restaurant for the food to be cooked WRONG. WHY!"
08/07/2011,ConnecticutYankee267,5.0,"The Sunday ""Prime Rib Special"" is the best bargain in town. During the summer you must go between the hours of 4 - 6 PM. It is an incredible deal and we always leave there with packages of left-overs. Great food!"
08/06/2011,MarkS,5.0,excellent job - we'll be back again soon!!
08/06/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We received exceptional service on our night out. I had requested a romantic table for our anniversary and we were given a table in the back of the restaurant. Not only was this to be our 1 year anniversary of dating but my boyfriend had called a few days earlier to request a bottle of champagne be delivered to our table at the end of our meal. He was going to propose! It was a wonderful engagement and we were pressed go eat quickly and we enjoyed our engagement. The restaurant was packed so I truly appreciate them letting us enjoy our dinner and time together.
08/06/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We ordered 4 different entrees :Rack of Lamb, American Kobe skirt steak, the New York Strip, and the special they have (steak with lobster risotto cake). All were cooked and seasoned to our liking. We also had the Garlic bread with blue cheese fondue, that was really good as well.

The staff was really good. The place was not loud and it was packed. We were really happy."
08/06/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"way to expensive for what you get, steak tasted like i could have made it at home, nothing special here"
08/06/2011,Esteban,4.0,My wife and I were hoping to have a romantic dinner during a kid free getaway and it wasn't quite what we were expecting. The table we were sat at was about a foot away from two men who were also dining. We could hear everything they were saying so odds are that they could hear us. It wasn't very intimate. The other was the noise level. It was really loud. The food on the other hand was very good. The meals were perfectly prepared. It was a bit pricey though.
08/05/2011,danap,2.0,I thought the food was just o.k. considering the price you pay. I found my meal to be very salty.
08/05/2011,pacmangolf,5.0,I love this place. EVERY time that we have been here we have had a good time. Last night was no exception. The lobster chowder is GREAT as a starter. My meals were fillet and crab cake which is a signature dish here and should not be missed. Service was GREAT...ANOTHER great night with Michael!!!
08/03/2011,dannyboy,5.0,"extremely satisfied with my MJ experience. waiter brian was fantastic...dying to please and make suggestions. did not steer us wrong. my wife,daughter and myself had the perfect evening. the mac and cheese side dish was over the top good. 5 star rating."
07/31/2011,DiverJoe,5.0,"As a couple were seated immediately at a romantic table, but it took 10 minutes for a waitress to stop by. However, once she arrived the service was great and perfectly timed. The food was super and we can highly recommend the garlic bread with blue cheese fondue. Another high note was the corkage service, as we had a special bottle in search of some great food. Thanks you MJs for a great romantic dinner."
07/30/2011,sebe,4.0,Food and service was excellent. Even though it is a steakhouse it would be nice to see a little more variety on the menu like a pasta dish and additional chicken dishes.
07/30/2011,Shirl,4.0,"It was my birthday and so they gave us a great booth table - my husband and I got to sit side by side and look out at the restaurant - food was yummy - great steaks,garlic bread and drinks - only thing I would skip are the oysters - they looked more like little neck clams - not what we are used to.."
07/28/2011,Rich,5.0,"we enjoyed the shrimp cocktail, one of us had chicken and the other beef.......both outstanding. Service impecable and Casey Reid, the general manager, is great."
07/24/2011,Visitor,5.0,"Fantastic meal! Prime rib nothing less than awesome, melt in your mouth. Creamed spinach a must have and you can't miss the Baked Alaska."
07/24/2011,WKCT,5.0,Michael Jordans Steakhouse at Mohegan Sun provided excellent food and service. The portions are huge and everything was cooked perfectly. The Porterhouse steak for two was 34 oz and there are many choices for sides. You can easily split a salad or appetizer and dessert due to portion sizes. Our table of 4 shared the 23 layer chocolate cake. The restaurant is extremely popular and reservations are strongly suggested. The restaurant is expensive(about $75-$100 per person) including 3 courses however it is great for a special occasion and a great way to spend a few hours at the casino.
07/23/2011,BeverlyF,5.0,"Wonderful restaurant! I thought it was going to be very pricy, but the price was just right!!! The steak was amazing!! I will be coming back!!!"
07/22/2011,Love2dine,5.0,Excellent dinner as usual!! Service excellent too!!
07/18/2011,joytotheworld,5.0,The food and wine is top notch!
07/15/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food was excellent I had the cowboy steak with Mexican chocolate sauce med rare and it was perfect. My wife had the halibut special and she enjoyed it also. The wedge salad was very good and we also had the shrimp cocktail and lobster chowder. Lia was our sever and she was very pleasant bringing our food and drinks at just the right pace. The bartender also makes a great Crown Royal and Ginger. I have eaten at Michael Jordans at least a dozen times and it is consistenly the best restaurant at Mogegan Sun Casino.

07/13/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Excellent wait staff, great steaks."
07/13/2011,BigbadBrooklynTad,5.0,"Excellent Steaks, cooked as ordered! The cowboy and Kansas City Strip were very flavorful and tender. Neither sauce overwhelmed the flavor of the steaks. The Lobster Chowder had large chunks of lobster. The Garlic bread was amazing. The Mac & cheese carbanara was excellent but very rich, a side to share. Only complaint the mojitos were ok, but nothing special."
07/10/2011,ToddJ,5.0,"Food was terrific. The blue cheese bread is a great way to start. The portions are HUGE, including the sides. It is noisy so you have to talk pretty loud. Maybe a corner booth for couples would be a little quieter, but we were with a group. Overall We will be back when we are there for a special night."
07/10/2011,ALANL,2.0,We were really looking forward to eating here but were very disappointed at the food quality and horrible service we experienced. This group is not very picky and the four members of our group all concluded that we would never eat there again. A separate group had a different server and ate at a different time and had the same experience.
07/09/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"I'm a steak eater, and this was the best I've had in years. All three of us were very
satisfied with the quality of all the food.(appetizers, main meal) excellent."
07/09/2011,JeanT,4.0,Food and service was exceptional!!! Would go back in a heartbeat! Waiter was fantastic. We ordered a bottle of wine and he made an alternate recommendation which was absolutely fantastic!
07/09/2011,CarolineC,4.0,"We had dinner here for my boyfriend's birthday on a Friday night. We had the garlic bread as an appetizer and it was soo delicious. For entrees my bf had the Cowboy steak and I had the kobe sliced steak. Both were cooked medium rare as requested. We also had the MJ home fries which were also quite delicious. The food was so good we came back again for dinner the next night (we went to the Keith Urban concert which didn't end until after 11pm, so many other restaurants were closing at that time)."
07/08/2011,GG11,4.0,"Food was excellent, but I expected nothing less. Steaks were cooked to perfection and the house bread was fresh, warm and tasty. Salad and lobster soup excellent as well.

Only downside was the VERY close accomodations and feeling like the next table over was so near us they were almost part of our dinner. Little privacy for the tables for two."
07/08/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Everything was great once they seated us away from the kitchen
07/08/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,We often eat at fine dining establishments and some fall short of our expectations. this was not the case at Michael Jordan's. The wait staff were friendly and helpful. Food arrived hot and cooked to our requested doneness ( black and blue for me and medium for my husband). We were quite pleased and will return if we go to Mohegan Sun again.
07/07/2011,pacmangolf,5.0,"Lea, our server did a very nice job pacing our dinner. The lobster cowder as a starter is OUTSTANDING, aome of the best I have had. Rich and FULL of lobster. Main courses were Fillet Mignon, seared scallops and crab cake. Hard to say which one of these great dishes was better as they were ALL OUTSTANDING. Baked Alaska shared for desert put an explanation point on our meal. OUTSTANDING!!!"
07/06/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,very good meal and service. server brought mini birthday cake and candle when she learned of birthday. nice touch!
07/03/2011,josephmpalladino,3.0,"The food and service are always top notch, however, in this instance the fact that we had reservatiions at 7 made no difference. We waited over 1/2 an hour because th restaurnt told us the over booked. I am sorry but if they expect patrons to arrive on time they should take inot account times required so that can reasonably accomodate the reservation time."
07/03/2011,MikeG,5.0,"We were so pleased with the Sunday Prime Rib Dinner. The food was exceptional, and the price was within our budget. We also enjoyed the wine, however, would prefer there to have been some selections less than $49.00 a bottle."
07/03/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Had a great time. Food and service were excellent. Nothing to complain about. Romantic night atmosphere.
07/02/2011,Rich,5.0,Great wine list. Steaks tender and flavorful and service was outstanding. General manager Casey is a class act and always ready to please.
06/30/2011,Luv2dine,4.0,"The service was off the charts, the server was attentive and readly available."
06/26/2011,Mel27,3.0,Not as good as on multiple previous visits. Steaks are too heavily glazed.
06/26/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Enjoyed our steak for two quite a bit. The potatoes were excellent and no complaints about the lobster bisque or the bread they served. Was a bit pricey, but that was expected. We will be going back."
06/26/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,this is a great place to go with a group. It is very loud and energic. Not a place for a quiet or romantic dinner.
06/24/2011,Excellent,5.0,Excellent ... all around! We'll be back.
06/19/2011,Cathy,4.0,"Love the garlic bread, love the steaks!!"
06/19/2011,JoJo,2.0,I request a booth and they didnt have one for us. They put us in a horrible table. We eat here every time we go to the casino and was very disappointed this time. Even our Delmonico wasnt up to the usually great taste! The garlic bread and the waitress where excellent!! Might have to take a break from MJ's next time!
06/17/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,third time there... and another perfect steak.
06/16/2011,Ginger,4.0,very pleasant experienc...great food service and ambience. A little overpriced.
06/14/2011,sanfrandiner,4.0,Michael Jordan's is a good streak house any time of day! We stopped in for lunch and were not disappointed.
06/12/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Fantastic steakhouse! Request Laura for your waitress she is simply fantastic!
06/12/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food was excellent and the servers were very accommodating. The garlic bread with blue cheese fondue was a real treat. The steaks were cooked to perfection (they have you check so that if it is wrong they take it right back) and the side dishes were huge.
06/11/2011,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"The food was good, not great, just good. I had high expectations and was somewhat dissapointed.
Staff was attentive.
Very noisey, but it is in a casino, so I guess that should have been expected.
Overall experience was dissapointing!"
06/11/2011,ShelleyH,4.0,We love going to Mohegan Sun and taking our kids to KidsQuest. Then we have dinner at one of the nicer restaurants. We always enjoy the meal at MJ's. The service is attentive and the food is quite good. This night we did have the onion rings and didn't enjoy them like we have on other occasions. They were doughy and we didn't eat them. When we mentioned it to the assistant server she really didn't say much. I thought the complaint should have been addressed.
06/11/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Everyone from bar Tender, Hostess and Wait Staff were excellent and added to a good dining experience. Food was delicious."
06/10/2011,Mariceann,3.0,Way over-priced. No tablecloths. Everything ala carte.
06/06/2011,JuneB,5.0,"We loved it. Great service, excellent drinks and steak that melts in your mouth."
06/06/2011,OpenTable Diner,3.0,I asked for a booth but could not get one. The girl at the front desk was a little confused and seemed she could not handle the group that was coming in. She forgot about us after we check in for our reservation and took people ahead of us.Food was good
06/06/2011,LindaR,4.0,"The restaurant was very good, perfect for a mother and daughter to catch up on the past few months. Quiet enough for a conversation, yet you can still feel the buzzing atmosphere."
06/02/2011,PhilB,2.0,The food was very expensive and not much too eat. There should have been at least 1 thing served with the steak.
05/29/2011,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"It was nice,however not all that. Food was okay, still I like better David Burke's surf and turf from the menu selection. Service was okay, it took the waitress 20 minutes to take just our drinks, I was even ready to order my desert, thats how long we had to wait, rest was not even full. Anyways, it was an okay experience- I would not recommend it though..like I said its not all that, it what just Blah!"
05/22/2011,ArielleM,5.0,The food was excellent and so was the service. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who doesn't mind a pricey meal that the food is excellent!
05/22/2011,Maryct70,4.0,Lovely waitress who was informative and attentive without being obtrusive. Lively casino restaurant. Great steaks and a nice bottle of wine. Perfect Special Occasion dinner.
05/22/2011,annabanana09,5.0,Food was excellent!!! Great service and a wonderful evening!
05/21/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Steak was so tender you could cut it with a knife. Garlic bread is great.
05/18/2011,Sharon,5.0,"The food was great, and the service was impeccable. It was a great meal! Will definitely go again for the next special occasion."
05/15/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,A little $$$ but the food was excellent. Dessert is a must!
05/14/2011,JMbbbbbbnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn,5.0,Excellent!! From soup to nuts! Would definitely return!
05/12/2011,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"Food was OK but nothing very special.  Way too noisey to enjoy as a couple out for a ""quiet, romantic"" dinner!"
05/08/2011,karemel,5.0,"Never actually had a ""bad"" experience or dinner at MJ Steakhouse."
05/07/2011,CatherineM,5.0,Thi is the place to go for that ultra special occasion. The food was amazing huge portions!
05/07/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Steaks were awsome!! Love Michael Jordans crab cakes they are the best.
05/07/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Went here with my girlfriends before seeing Bon Jovi. Food and service were excellent once again!
05/07/2011,NOYB,2.0,The steaks were only fair. The prices are very high so I expected better quality. I would not go back nor recommend this restaurant.
05/01/2011,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Recommended with realistic expectations. The food was fair to good, not at all above average. Seems overpriced for quality. Taking a Michael Jordan fan might be the only apropriate ""special occasion""."
05/01/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"This is the second time I have dined at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse. I am not a lover of Steak, but I did enjoy the sea scallops. They were outstanding! I would highly recommend their Garlic Bread with Blue Cheese Fondue, and their Mac and Cheese and Truffle Fries."
05/01/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,The food was very good. The garlic bread appetizer was amazing and would not skip. Steaks were delicious and cooked exactly the way we wanted. The servers also wait when they bring you your steak to make sure it is cooked the way you like. Nice touch! Our waitress was excellent. Any question we had she steered us in the right direction. We also needed to change our reservation at the last minute and they were very accommodating.
04/30/2011,James,5.0,MJ is always a great place to eat. The food is excellent. It is well presented and the service is outstanding.
04/30/2011,nib22152,4.0,"Steak was tender, moist and so very tasteful!"
04/29/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Not sure what youa would call them, but the Waiter's Assistant was very attentive to filling up my daughters water glass. My daughter tends to drink quite a bit of water. But our waiter and his assistant did a very good job and we were very pleased."
04/29/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,As always the food and service did not leave us dissapointed
04/29/2011,OpenTable Diner,2.0,Steak was very tough and not good at all especially for the price. Used to be very good years ago. Would think twice about ever going back.
04/28/2011,DrNo,3.0,All in all it was enjoyable. I don't think the steaks are as good as at other steakhouses I have been to.
04/27/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Celebrating a special occasion became even more special at Michael Jordan's ! Service was excellent and the food was superior. The Porterhouse for two is to die for and was done to perfection. Impressive wine list! We had a wonderfully romantic booth setting, just private enough for the two of us but not too secluded to people watch too. Generous portions and the garlic bread was sinful !!!! It was a wonderful meal to linger over..very much looking forward to return visits."
04/23/2011,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Steaks and food in gerneral were very good. However, ambiance (needs to be queiter, tables further appart) and service (need to hire more staff) can be improved and is no where close to what I expected. This doesn't compete with top restaurants at other casinos (Atlantic City and Las Vegas)."
04/23/2011,OpenTable Diner,3.0,American kobe skirt steak was not tender at all. Very chest.
04/22/2011,KerinG,5.0,"MJ steakhouse has delicious food!!! Tuna tartare, lobster mashed are to die for!"
04/22/2011,AmyM,5.0,The food was outstanding and the waitstaff was Excellent!
04/17/2011,Carriebb21,5.0,Uniquely prepared food with impeccable service and a perfectly paced meal with a delicious outcome.
04/17/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The food was good. We did enjoy our meal. It is overpriced, but, that's what you get at a casino. We normally would not dine here because of the cost, but we were celebrating our anniversary and found we had no other option for us unless we wanted to ""hit the buffet""."
04/16/2011,mjcat12,4.0,"It was wonderful, except that the waitress overcharged us by $30. She told us the bill was messed up because she (in error) put another table's order with ours, but she sorted it out, and we were really making out, because we did not have to pay for the garlic bread. When my husband and I looked at the bill, we saw that it was really wrong, but not in the way she presented it. The bill was corrected and we pay the corrected amount."
04/15/2011,DKNYLI,3.0,"First time eating at MJ's. The cafe next door was always very good. The steaks were cooked perfectly but were not the prime cuts you'd exact from a ""steakhouse."" They were good, not great. The salads were excellent and the sides were good. The espresso was excellent. I felt the service was outstanding and opentable.com had me reserved and seated 30 mins later. I would dine here again, but I would not go out of my way to do so. Overall 1-10 on the premiere steakhouse scale, MJ's is a 7."
04/15/2011,OpenTable Diner,3.0,The food was fantastic but the atmosphere was lacking.
04/15/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,I love the atmosphere and the staff. Very polite and helpful when it comes to choosing from the menu. Food was very good and served hot. I go there everytime I'm in town. I proposed to my wife there!!!
04/10/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,It would have been hard for me to find something that I didn't like about Michael Jordan's. Everyone was helpful and extremely cordial - the food was outstanding. I'd have to rate the experience as one of the best ever.
04/09/2011,IreneB,5.0,"We had an excellent dinner at Micheal Jordan's Steakhouse at mohegan sun. Even though it was very busy, the sevice and fod was Excellent."
04/09/2011,PaulJ,5.0,"Fantastic restaurant did not disappoint at all. Lived up to all of the recommendations I had read. Prompt very attentive service, excellent food. Definately will return in the near future."
04/08/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,My wife and I were Delighted once again at the greatest Steak house ever! Loved it! Thank you Michael Jordan for such a great place to get away and Eat the best!
04/08/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Excellent like always but was very disappointed in the sports bar when refused a table. Cause I would not confirm I would be buying a full meal. The funny part is we went to another place and spent well over 400.
04/03/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Great food, porterhouse for two was wonderful and the Lobster Chowder was also a big hit with our group."
04/03/2011,Lunch,3.0,"Had a great dinner there with my wife...we've been there before. This time though, the service was disappointing. Our waitresses double charged our gift card which wiped it's balance out completely. Now, we're not unreasonable people...mistakes happen. Not a big deal...but how it was handled was not so cool. We sat there for over a half hour waiting for a manager to resolve this. We were told it would have to be mailed to us. Now, it makes total sense that there are protocols in place in a casino...but did we really need to sit there twiddling our thumbs for all of that? We're a little disappointed with their lack of attention to customer satisfaction. They gave us no incentive to come back other than the apology we got walking out."
04/02/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"It was great, couldn't have been happier with the food or service!"
04/02/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The restaurant was great! I went to celebrate my birthday & had a lovely time!! Great place!!!!
04/02/2011,inthebiz,5.0,"Overall a great experience. I took my wife there for her birthday. Having worked in the restaurant business, I can say that the food came out technically correct. Started with the ahi tuna tartar and ahi tempura. Entrees were Delmonico that was Oscared and rack of lamb. Both were cooked to order. Desert was 23 layer chocolate cake and creme brule. My wife said my creme brule is better, I agree. The only thing I would change is the lighting, a little more. The two main best points of the night were, the server Danielle was outstanding and this has been the only restaurant that has correctly made an old fashioned in at least 20 years."
04/01/2011,TheChief,5.0,"Have been here several times, but my most recent visit was the best yet. Cowboy ribeye was perfect, Garlic bread fondue was also delicious"
03/27/2011,Betty,5.0,"We loved it!! Great food, good price."
03/27/2011,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"arugula salad was fantastic, onion rings and potatoes were good, filet was jsut okay, did not love the glaze"
03/27/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Justin our waiter was awesome! he was alot of fun and got the job done. All the staff was friendly. food was delicious.
03/27/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Great experience - great food and great service - what else can you ask for? It is on my top 5 best restaurants that I've gone to! The appetizers were to die for - we had the garlic bread (which we would like to thank the waitress for suggesting that!) - unbelievable - never had anything like it - and the tuna tartare was excellent. The steaks (filets) were also excellent - loved that the server asked us to cut the steak to see if it was to our liking before he left the table. Unbelievable. We will definitely go back. The only thing i didnt like was the location of the table (right near the serving station) - but the food and service made up for it. Great going Michael Jordan!
03/23/2011,AnnieC,2.0,Food was very salty! I think I like Tuscany better!
03/19/2011,Leslie,4.0,Food was excellent!!! Service was just OK/
03/19/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"This was our second trip to Michael Jordan's Steakhouse and it was just as wonderful as the first! We brought friends with us who hadn't previously been because we were looking for some place nice and, frankly, we wanted to impress them. Well...it worked!! They were very impressed with everything, especially the food. I look forward to going there again!"
03/16/2011,AdamV,5.0,"Had dinner before concert. Food and service were great and although we received everything in a timely manner, we never felt rushed. Would definitely go back not just because we were at the casino but specifically to dine at the restaurant."
03/13/2011,karemel,4.0,Love the food almost as much as we loved #23
03/12/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Food & service is always wonderful. We had another great meal!!
03/12/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Steaks were good but not great.
03/11/2011,Holly11,5.0,The best restaurant in Mohegan Sun. Have been there many times and the restaurant is always consistent- you will have a great meal. The only complaint is that the restaurant is very noisy-they need something to absorb the sound.
03/11/2011,DeniseH,4.0,"The food (esp. the garlic bread) was delicious, the service was great. However, for the price we paid for the food the ambiance was horrible. It was to LOUD, we could not hear each other talk."
03/11/2011,Tony,5.0,"The food, and service is fabulous. They were very accomodating and want to please the customer."
03/10/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,We had a wonderful meal with great service.
03/10/2011,AnnieC,1.0,Food was too salty.. Waiter's service was terrible.
03/07/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday and we had such an amazing experience! Great service, amazing food and drinks! Very romantic, couldnt ask for anything more! :)"
03/07/2011,JoJo,4.0,The food is ALWAYS great!! Delmonico steak is the best... but don't forget to start with the garlic bread with Blue Cheese Fondue!!!
03/06/2011,Susan4,5.0,"We had a fabulous time, our reservation was ready on time, and the booth we requested was waiting for us. The food and service as always was fantastic."
03/06/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Excellent service, excellent food"
03/06/2011,JenniferW,4.0,Overall this was a very good experience. The food was excellent...the Blue Cheese Garlic Bread was to die for...and the steaks were cooked perfectly! The service left a little bit to be desired...Server seemed rushed and didn't take time to explain anything...and forgot our appetizer order at first...the restaurant was a little loud and a little cramped for space not recommended for a romantic setting.
03/06/2011,SusanM,5.0,It was wonderful when we were there almost 3 years ago and excellent this time too.
03/05/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"What a wonderful experience. The food was delectable, the service was exceptional and the ambiance was perfect! Looking forward to my next dining experience!"
03/05/2011,Kpbg,3.0,Great food in a beautiful but loud place with SOME attentive servers- we just didn't get one.
03/04/2011,LM2021,2.0,"Food was good but I was very disappointed. Overall experience was diminished as our party arrived early for our 530 reservation having driven down from Boston. We were forced to wait 45 minutes and were not seated til 7:15!!! We missed the beginning if the 8:00 show which we had tickets for. Service staff was nice but we rarely saw our server and were attended to by two trainees (who tried very hard and were good considering they were in training) The disorganization of seating parties in order of their reservations was evident. After promises that a number if tables had just opened up and we were next in queue, 5 other groups were seated ahead of us and our hostess was wrangling with another for seating. There were empty tables!"
03/04/2011,OpenTable Diner,3.0,My wife and I went for our second time prior to attending a concert. Our server Thomas was rude and obviously not prepared for a busy evening. At these prices your waiter should be well mannered and attentive.
03/04/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellent all around...does suffer from some drafty areas
03/04/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We had a great dinner before heading to a concert at Mohegan Sun. The steaks were cooked to perfection, and the sides are big enough to share (try the giant onion rings!) The only disappointment was the 23-layer chocolate cake. Just make your reseration early!"
03/03/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,love the garlic bread and fries the steak if the best anywhere.
03/03/2011,pacmangolf,5.0,Outstanding from start to finish. Rack of Lamb was to die for
03/02/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Best Filet Mignon I have had in a long, long time. Worth the price!"
02/27/2011,Jenifer,3.0,I wish the table for 2 were not so close to each other. Hard to have a private conversation.
02/27/2011,JohnD,5.0,Excellent food and excellent service.
02/27/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,AMAZING food!!! Everything was cooked to perfection and food was nice and hot. Great service & fun atmosphere. I will definately return.
02/27/2011,Awesome,5.0,We went with our son and his girlfriend for there 3 year ann. It was wonderful.. Food was fantistic. The staff is wonderful. they make sure you are comfortable from the moment you come in to the point that you leave. I would go again and again. The wine list was supurb.
02/26/2011,CRivs,4.0,"The food was very good but ok for a steakhouse. My boyfriend ordered a steak medium rare, it came back rare. You could tell simply by testing it with your finger. The cook should have known that. I had a tuna steak over a sushi rice cake. The dish would have been better without the rice cake. It absorbed all of the sauce and it was more like eating sushi rice completely drenched in soy sauce. The truffle fries and spinach with parmesean were good. The garlic bread with blue cheese - to die for!"
02/26/2011,Irishprincess,3.0,"The steaks were good, but not great. Dessert menu left some to be desired. I'm glad we made reservations as the resturant was packed. Skip this if you're looking for a romantic place. I could barely hear conversations from across our table of 4."
02/26/2011,Dianna,5.0,we like michael jordon's for it quality menu and excellant service
02/23/2011,andream,5.0,Great place with a good atmosphere!
02/22/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The restaurant was great. Huge dining room with many tables so great if your coming with a group. Food and service was top notch.
02/21/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Excellent dining experience. It was very crowded the night we were there, consequently, due to the high ceilings, it was very loud. Service was prompt and courteous. Food was excellent.
I would recommend this restaurant."
02/20/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"This was our second time dining at the restaurant so we knew what to expect. Last year the food was amazing. However, this year the cowboy steak was extremely fatty and smaller than the previous year. The lobster mashed potatoes were very dry and contained mostly the extra meat that is tough."
02/20/2011,LindaP4345,4.0,"My companion and I enjoyed the prime rib special.
It was very good and the mashed potatoes were yummy.
The service from our waitress and our bus person was very good."
02/20/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Everything was great from start to finish
02/20/2011,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"The wait staff brought our main course out before we finished the appetizer, we felt a little rushed."
02/20/2011,JimK,4.0,"Food was excellent, atmosphere very good, service mediocre. We felt like our server was too busy to take a real interest in our table."
02/20/2011,Sross,5.0,Never fad a bad meal there. My wife and I love it!
02/19/2011,nicojsar,5.0,I enjoy going to this restaurant for the food and ambiance
02/19/2011,LaurenAshley,5.0,The garlic bread with blue cheese fondue was absolutely amazing. All four of us ordered the filet mignon and it was cooked perfectly. I highly recommend the french fries with truffle oil!
02/18/2011,RichK,5.0,"Everything was great from the moment we walked into the restaraunt. Our reservation was on time with no wait. The service is outstanding, very attentive yet not bothersome! Our server was pleasent and did a great job! The quality of the food was fantastic. Michael Jordan's is and has been out first dining choice at Mohegan Sun whenever we attend a show at this venue!"
02/17/2011,Stegel,5.0,"Jordan's Steak House has a special place in my heart (stomach?) ever since one of my clients took me there for my 21st birthday. My fiance and I have gone twice to the steakhouse and loved every moment of both experiences. The steaks are always perfectly cooked, seasoned, and placed on the plate and the garlic bread w/ blue cheese sauce are a mouthwatering appetizer."
02/16/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"This was a very good place to dine, but I don't give it 5 stars because it wasn't as good as the first time we dined here. Our first visit was over a year ago. It was perfect. This visit felt rushed, which we refused to be rushed. Also we got our app before we got our drinks. Not good in my book. Food was great. Will go back."
02/15/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Never anything but excellence from Michael Jordans. Delicious food and romantic atmosphere.
02/15/2011,Ddeep,3.0,"I was annoyed by the host who sat us next to the wait stand although many other tables were available and booths were ""reserved"". We had an Open Table reservation and I couldn't help but think that they penalized us for having a reservation through a third party. The food was good but expensive and our waitress was great."
02/14/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Staff was friendly. Menu not very detailed. portions were smaller than expected exspecailly for price.
02/14/2011,RichF,5.0,Food is always amazing and steaks are always cooked to perfection.
02/13/2011,Stephanie,5.0,"The food was INCREDIBLE and worth every penny, and I totally love the modern and dim-lit atmosphere. We will definitely come here again for a special occasion. A little pricey for to dine here regularly."
02/13/2011,Cfaka,5.0,"Great food(esp. their steak) great service and great atmosphere. You are going to pay, but you get what you pay for and its worth it! My Husband and I come here for Vday every year(as a treat) for us. Its a great special occasion choice!"
02/12/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Went here for Valentine's Day. Small selection of food but everything we ordered was perfestly cooked and tasted awesome. The service was attentive and everyone was very polite! Even though we did take our two-year-old with us and there were other children there I didn't check kid-friendly because it is a nice and quieter restaraunt than what I would consider ""kid-friendly."""
02/12/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The crab and shrimp apps. were standard fare and for the prices charged should have a better presentation. Iceberg wedge with blue cheese and bacon...should contain more chopped bacon.
Porterhouse for two, actually fed three people. Excellent quality and grilled to our specs. Only stand out among the side dishes was the corn. The 23 layer chocolate cake was too cold...should be served closer to room temp in order to develop more flavor.

Note: It was our fourth time dining at Jordon's."
02/12/2011,OpenTable Diner,3.0,This restaurant is fantastic...usually the waitstaff is on top of it's game! The steaks are incredibly delicious and the desserts are fantastic!
02/12/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The Garlic Bread with the cheese sauce is spectacular, cannot say enough about that bread. I would go there again JUST to eat that delicious bread."
02/11/2011,DiverJoe,5.0,"Great food, but way too dark at the table we had.  Upside was the ability to bring a special bottle of wine - I didn't expect that at a casino known for overly strict alcohol policies.  It's nice to see that real restraunt perks like corkage are available at MJs."
02/06/2011,Tina,5.0,Excellent steak house - great food cooked perfectly. Pricey but totally worth it.
01/31/2011,OpenTable Diner,2.0,I ordered medium steak and it came back rare. My wife ordered scallops and they were mushy with no flavor. Very expensive for a below average meal!
01/30/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Had a great meal, great service and a great overall experience at Michael Jordan's! Fabulous, cozy, private booth with Velvet pillows was so comfortable and had a great view of the restaurant. Food was spectacular, steaks were perfectly cooked, seafood was fresh and delicious. It's always busy, reservations are a must or you'll wait a long time."
01/30/2011,gerryc,4.0,"the hostess stand had a lot to be desired. We arrived early, and was told they would not have the table ready for 15-20 minutes. When we returned we were told the table would not be ready for another 10-15 minutes. We were called at that time and then told the table was still not ready. A 7pm reservation should be 7pm, not 7:30 pm.

The Porterhouse Steak for 2 a solid choice. And the Garlic Bread Fondue is worth trying. and if you are up for a challenge, try the 23 layer Chocolate Cake."
01/29/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"WE enjoyed the food at Michael Jordan's; it was well prepared and tasty. There was WAY too much of it though. I ordered a chicken dish and it was an entire chicken cut up and roasted. Since the restaurant is in a casino, and we were planning on spending the evening there, we could not take any leftovers with us. A great deal must have been thrown out (the ala cart sides were way too big too) and it felt wasteful. It was fairly noisy and crowded, but considering the casino setting, not terrible. The waiters were excellent."
01/29/2011,KevinM,5.0,"Michael Jordan's Steakhouse is far and away the superior dining experience venue in Mohegan Sun Casino and Resort. The only way it could have been better would have been if Micheal Jordan stopped by our table to ""chat hoops!""
Kevin McBride"
01/29/2011,KarenD,4.0,"I had last been here about four years ago. As such the decor seemed a little worn/dated as it hadn't been updated since then. It was VERY noisy (i.e. you almost had to shout to hear your dinner companion). Though pricey, the food was phenomenal. So tasty. Everything was excellent. The caesar salad was awesome. And I highly recommend the garlic bread with the bleu cheese fondeu dip. We each had a Kansas City Strip steak. So good. The marinade was out of this world. We shared the corn off the cob and Yukon Gold mashed sides. Both delicious. Wait staff seemed very rushed. I know it's a crowded venue given its location in Mohegan Sun but for the prices you would expect a more relaxed dining experience."
01/29/2011,lambo,2.0,"Although the food was excellent, it was dampend by a rude hostess with NO personality. I arrived 30min prior to our 5:30 reservation and was told I had to wait till reservation time for seating. I agreed and put in a special request for a private table since it was a special occasion, our anniversary. She kept us waiting in the bar till I had to ask again and then she didn't even acknowledge I was waiting and worse! she had us sit in the most high traffic area in the bar area!!! This after i saw couples being seated in private and semi-private areas before us. Ruined our night, because i had to complain several times even to the matradee. Who was annoyed at us. Poor planning on her part and we suffered. And not like it was busy either."
01/29/2011,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Make reservations, or you can't get in. We dined at 5pm it's a good ideal to ask for a booth, it's quiet and cozy. I ordered the garlic bread and bluecheese fondue a must try! I ordered the scallops, done perfectly! My husband ordered the filet and wasn't dispointed Very good atmosphere would diff go back again...pricey"
01/29/2011,OpenTable Diner,1.0,RIDICULOUS!!!! We had to wait a 20 minutes for a table for which we had a reservation for.  Also our food was cold and our waitor was no where to be found.
01/29/2011,Islander,5.0,"From the Maytag blue cheese garlic bread, to the beet salad... the oysters... the salmon was superb-- one course was better than the next! Be sure to request a booth- it was cozy & romantic."
01/16/2011,coachwit,4.0,"Had a 5:30 reservation beforw a 7:00 show. Was seated promptly and had a relaxing, excellent dinner. Waitress (Tenisha) was very personable and thorough. Sunday night Prime Rib dinner is a great deal."
01/15/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Experience was great. Would go again.
01/15/2011,TOM14369,5.0,ALWAYS JUST AN OUSTANDING MEAL.I DRIVE 2 HOURS TO GO THERE..
01/14/2011,Rich,3.0,Pricey and food was good but not exceptional. Service was prompt.
01/10/2011,OpenTable Diner,1.0,The steaks were inedible. We had the special and the cut of beef was so poor that it had the toughness of a non prime cut. The other steak ordered was not cooked to my liking and after sending it back it was re-seared with the glaze still on the meat and when the glaze was re-administered the resulting taste was poor....and it still was not cooked right. In addition the Stag's Leap wine that was served was cold. I was instructed that it is policy to serve it at 70 degrees but it seemed much colder than that. It seemed as if it was stored in a cold area and not brought to proper temperature.
01/09/2011,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Love this place, they never disappoint. My meal was PERFECT."
01/09/2011,OpenTable Diner,3.0,The food is excellent.However we went on a Saturday night and could not hear each other across the table.For the price it is not worth it. Had to sit on a bench rubbing elbows with the couple next to us.
01/02/2011,Lester,5.0,"We had a wonderful time. The food and wine was perfect. Excellent and personable service. We could stay and talk, and were not rushed at all. I look forward to returning."
01/02/2011,MikeLCT,3.0,"overall enjoyed Michael Jordan's. The filet mignon was excellent, but the more expensive Kansas City Strip steak (recommended by server) was not as flavorful. Desserts were average. Our requests added in our open table reservation were graciously honored. Crabcake appetizer was as exceptional as stated by our server. Service was warm, gracious and 'just right' in the amount of attention we received. We were glad we had 3 people, however, as tables for 2 are pretty close together."
01/01/2011,Merlin,4.0,"Service is attentive but not overbearing and portions are huge. A side dish is easily split by two people. I do wish they had some smaller portions of steak, as I can't eat 14 oz. in one clip. Bring your wallet, as a bottle of wine, two meals, and 2 sides ran about $200."
01/01/2011,Nicole,5.0,The food here was AMAZING their garlic bread w/blue cheese was so good....I could have eaten 3 plates of it....I had the rack of lamb. Small as usual but delish....the meat melted in my mouth. Lobster rissotto also delicious...we didn't have time for dessert(we had to atch a show) but we were in a rush and the server got us in and out in under an hour. If we hit mohegan sun again this would definitely be a top of the list place to go.
12/31/2010,Magman,4.0,"Our first visit and we were treated very well. Great service and energetic staff. The most tender, flavorful filet I ever had. Beats Mortons and Flemings no contest!
The manager introduced himself and gave us a discount card to encourage our return. We had planned a return visit even before we recieved this offer."
12/30/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Love this restaurant. The food is fantastic (a bit pricey, but worth the special treat)! Would definitely recommend the garlic bread with blue cheese sauce as an appetizer :) One thing I would suggest putting on the menu - smaller size steaks. Don't get me wrong, the steak was awesome, just couldn't eat the entire thing because it was too big!"
12/29/2010,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"The steaks were marvelous. But the lobster soup was only so-so, and there was very little lobster in it. The garlic bread in blue cheese sauce lacked enough sauce.
The waitress was not attentive; we had to wait too long for particular wants or needs. I had to get another waitress to fetch our waitress.
The atmosphere was way too noisy. I expected a much more quiet and subdued atmosphere to prevail."
12/29/2010,JanetP,4.0,"Overall a very good experience. Was disappointed there was no mac and cheese on their ""holiday menu""."
12/18/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We are rarely disappointed when dining at Michael Jordan's and Saturday night was not an exception. The garlic bread with bleu cheese fondue is a ""must have"" whenever dining here - delicious. The three of us each ordered the filet mignon and they were cooked to perfection! The lobster mashed potatoes were delicious; having chunks of lobster meat but not overwhelming in a seafood flavor - you could still taste the potatoe. The grilled corn is always a favorite with a little kick (chipotle butter). Drink service was great and our main server, Michael, was Outstanding, as always. He really knows how to take care of his diners by being attentive yet not obtrusive."
12/08/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,third visit continues to be a favorite spot for dinner
12/04/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellent Kansas City strip steak!! Wine delicious. Everything a bit pricey.
12/03/2010,SandraS,5.0,Michael Jordan's Steakhouse Restaurant was one of the best restaurants that I have been to in a very long time.
12/03/2010,Lunaduna,2.0,Other people had told me that MJ's is hit or miss. I found it hard to believe....until this visit. The food was fair at best. For a steakhouse-it was rather pitiful that one steak at the table was overcooked. The food was warm at best. Hopefuly it was just a bad night.
12/03/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Had a wonderful and romantic evening. At first, was a little upset we were being seated at a teeny tiny table for two in the center of the dining area when the whole restaurant was practically ghost and the two of us would have much preferred a private booth for romance and privacy. Fortunate for us, the hostess was able to accommodate our request! Also, we were a bit upset to find out after the whole dining experience that Michael Jordan himself does NOT own the steakhouse...Instead it is owned by Cornerstone Restaurant Group who uses Michael Jordan's name for publicity."
11/29/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Michael Jordon's consistently provides high quality food - while a bit expensive, it is ideal for that ""special night out."" The garlic bread and the crabcake are noteworthy on a excellent menu."
11/28/2010,SusanO,5.0,"Enjoyed the experience-good food and great service
Celebrated my parents 59th anniversary in style!!!"
11/26/2010,LongIslandGirl,4.0,"Reservation system was great, our table was ready on time. The food was very good, as we have been to all the top name steakhouses in Manhattan. This was up there in rank. Food was prepared without spices, salt, etc as requested, and was still very good. Special Thanksgiving Day turkey and trimmings menu was offered, but we ordered off the regular menu anyway. Martini list included seasonal Pumpkin Martini, which was excellent. We would definitely go back."
11/25/2010,JillA,3.0,"Disappointed this time around: Bad table, so so service. It WAS Thanksgiving day so they were busy...but, we definitely felt neglected. The meal was very good though."
11/25/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Met my son at Mohegan frequently but this is first time we met on Thanksgiving and dined at Michael Jordan's, having thought it was overpriced and/or overhyped - I was wrong....staff was great, steak was awesome, we shared the turkey dinner with trimmings for tradition and the pumpkin cheesecake was perfect."
11/21/2010,CarlieH,5.0,We enjoyed our visit to Michael Jordan's. The food was excellent and the waitstaff was attentive without being intrusive. Will certainly go again.
11/19/2010,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"The only thing I didn't like at MJ's was my steak! I had a New York strip that was a good cut of meat, but the ""Michael Jordan's Rub"" that they marinate it in, in my opinion, ruined the flavor. I tasted my wife's filet mignon, with no rub, and it was very tasty. Next time, I'll order it ""naked."""
11/18/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Second time dining at this location. Steak Tartare was outstanding, unfortunately the entree sirloin steak was a bit grisly, otherwise cooked and seasoned perfectly. The frozen cappuccino dessert was the perfect way to finish the meal, light and sweet complimenting a nice cup of tea."
11/15/2010,OpenTable Diner,1.0,Never again- one of the worst prime rib roast meals we have ever had!
11/15/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The dinning experience my girlfriend and I had was great. I made our reservation on the open table website which was simple. With it being my birthday I requested a nice table, which the host did. The food was great and the abience was modern & quite. My recomendation is the garlic bread with blue cheese."
11/14/2010,Squirrell,3.0,Excellent meal. Horrible service.
11/13/2010,RobertD,5.0,Outstanding dinner and wait staff very professional and friendly
11/13/2010,MP0WER,5.0,"People argue that you're paying for a name, but you are truly paying for top notch quality and service that can only be expected of this name.

There is no wrong answer with any of the dishes, just beware if you order the crab cakes - there's no joke it's a cake full of lump crab meat not the mixture of meat and filler that you're used to.

Steaks are always perfectly and melt in your mouth.  Don't forget the garlic bread, or the 23 layer cake if you have room!"
11/13/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Awesome. I am a repeat customer, and am never disappointed. I had the special, two filets with Scallops, fabulous and the creme brule was to die for!!Great experience,Jeff..."
11/07/2010,memere,5.0,"We had a wonderful dinner,service was terrific, and many compliments to the chef. Presentation of the food was excellent."
11/07/2010,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by the hostess very kindly. We waited only approximately 2 mins to be seated. The restaurant is a bit dark but makes for a nice romantic setting, which I was looking for. The service was adequate but not extremely attentive. The server appeared to be have a couple too many tables to wait on. Thankfully we only ordered one appetizer, one drink a piece and our main course or we would have waited forever. The food was pretty good, not great for the price. I enjoyed the french fries and the atmosphere..."
11/07/2010,DougF,4.0,Great Steak and outstanding service.
11/05/2010,SarahC,5.0,"It was awesome. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. You guys let us bring a cake for a birthday surprise, so thanks! The Tempura Tuna appetizer was incredible, but so was the rest of the food. We'd love to come back in a second!"
10/30/2010,Kinct,4.0,Everything was delicious! On a busy Saturday evening our server was extremely attentive and absolutely did not try to rush us through dinner.
10/30/2010,Rich,5.0,"Food was outstanding and so was the service. Our waiter was cordial and johnny on the spot. My wife had the salmon and I had a steak. We also had manhattans and wine. Great wine menu. Baked potatoe is awesome--don't miss it. You will not be unhappy eating here. We eat here often since we live close by.....probably 3 or 4 times a month. The only difficulty is the front reception desk. Definitely not customer service oriented. We usually have to ask for a manager, Matt on this particular night, and he straightened things out immediately. Again, the manager makes it all work."
10/30/2010,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"The service started off just o.k.....we all felt a little rushed to order..as we had just gotton our cocktails...after he forgot our appitizers...he actually accused my husband of not having ordered them..as there were five (5) of us and we ALL heard him order them..this was very offensive..he offered to bring them while we ate our dinner..I don't think so...we never really saw him again until desert time....He never came over to pour the wine.(which I think in this type of venue would be top of the list...instead the bus boy folded our napkin when we got up...For the amount of money we spen...we were not even approached by managemen with a ""I'm Sorry may we offer you an after dinner drink or dessert on the house"" WE WOULD NOT GO BACK!!"
10/24/2010,RestaurantReview,4.0,"We had a reservation for 10:30 on a Saturday night, so I didn't think it would be too busy; but we still had to wait about 15-20 minutes for our table. It was very crowded but the food was excellent and the service great."
10/24/2010,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Too noisy..But I would go back. The food was excellent.
10/23/2010,KennethR,2.0,"We have been to Michael Jordan's on other occassions and had a better experience. Between the server who did not attend to our needs and the price of the menu, we would not return there. This occasion was to celebrate our son's 25th birthday. We will not be returning to this restaraunt."
10/22/2010,karemel,3.0,"Overall, our party of four was satisfied with the entire overall dining experience, although all four of the filet mignons ordered medium were served med well. Missed the ""old"" spinach salad not currently on the menu.

MJ's has always been the restaurant of choice by me and my family/friends when we go to the Mohegan Sun. And we are already deciding what we will order the next time we go."
10/22/2010,AmyA,5.0,"From the host, to the servers, and everyone inbetween, everything was outstanding. Very comfortable seating, fantastic ambiance. The food was incredible. The garlic bread in a fondue sauce was so good. Steaks were amazing. You finally get what you pay for in this restaurant. Awesome experience, will be back again."
10/20/2010,Fancy17,5.0,"I am never disappointed by this restaurant. Our waiter was attentive, but not overly so. Our food, steak and chops, was cooked to perfection. Appetizer, some kind of blue cheese bread thingy, was just delicious. And my cosmopolitan was prepared perfectly. We had a quiet little corner table and loved it. What amazed us, though, was although it was our anniversary and we hadn't said a word to them about it, they remembered from our visit the prior year and congratulated us! Superlative dining experience."
10/17/2010,Jeanandrick,4.0,"We had very good service and the food was very good, also. Atmosphere is OK - a bit noisy and too open to be intimate. Food prices were quite high - wines also high. We did enjoy our meal."
10/16/2010,ToddP,5.0,Everything was terrific from the staff to the food. A bit pricy but completely expected at the casino. I will frequent.
10/16/2010,KDHM,5.0,We go once a year for a special occasion and MJ Steakhouse never disappoints. AWESOME! The food is great. I got the scallops and my husband always gets the Kansas City Strip. Their Mac 'N Cheese is the best.
10/16/2010,MariaG,5.0,"An excellent experience. Even though we arrived early (1/2 hour) for our reservation, the hostess was able to seat us with no hesitation and no questions asked."
10/15/2010,Jake,3.0,"Food was outstanding, but very pricy. Everything is a la carte."
10/14/2010,JudieD,5.0,We had dinner for my husbands birthday the other night and it was superb. Our server Stacy recommended the garlic bread with the Blue cheese fondue which was a great suggestion. We split a salad and then we shared the porterhouse which was cooked to perfection. Stacey also recommended the grilled corn and we took her suggestion even though the birthday boy wanted the lobster mashed potatoes (carb overload). We definitely liked the corn over the mashed potatoes so it was a great recommendation. We let Stacey pick the dessert which was a pineapple coconut almond tart and it was incredible. Service was perfectly timed and we never felt rushed. She was awesome.
10/11/2010,ThomasF,4.0,"Service was excellent, food was a bit lacking from what I had remembered from past visits."
10/10/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"This place is in Mohegan Sun, so business lunches are difficult at best.  However that should not deter you from going, the food is outstanding as is the service.  I have been to Michael's many times and it has been consistently 5 star.  I've read other reviews with interest because many have claimed to have had less than positive experiences.  This has never been the case with me.  The steak and chicken has always been absolutely outstanding and cooked perfectly.  My family asks for this place again and again.  It isn't inexpensive however for a special occasion it is an exemplary restaurant.  I highly recommend it."
10/09/2010,zamboni03,4.0,"The food was very good. The food is passable as expected in a high end steakhouse but for the price I expected much more from the service. If you are used to going to high end steakhouses, be prepared to expect service not to measure up.

The service was lacking due to our server having too many tables. It was a Saturday night, so there are no excuses to why the restaurant didn't have enough servers on staff to properly serve everyone.

Also, the restaurant was loud. It wasn't the other guests it was the background music."
10/09/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,We've eaten at Michael Jordan's several times now and we've never been disappointed. The food and service are great and we'll keep going back.
10/08/2010,John,4.0,cowboy steak was outstanding. Very pleased with our dinner
10/07/2010,Princess,5.0,celebrated friends birthday and food was wonderful
10/03/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,As always it was great ! Everything was cooked perfect ! We had a great waiter ! It was just a great meal !
10/02/2010,ReallyOughtToDiet,5.0,"My wife and I went to Michael Jordan's for our anniversary. the restaurant had come highly recommended by a friend and a review of the online menu, while not extreme, seemed focused on some excellent food.

The recommendation was right on target. Our waiter Brian was excellent, very attentive without being overbearing. Our food was excellent, and the wines (we each had half bottles of our favorites) were wonderfully paired. It was a bit noisy, but that, in my opinion, is a good sign of a great restaurant, and the guy at the table across from us was great entertainment trying hard to impress his date.

Overall, a memorable and tasty experience!"
09/28/2010,Farmingtonfoodie,4.0,Porterhouse steak was incredible! Unfortunately the martinis we ordered to go with them tasted watered down and we sent them back.
09/26/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"To me, it is far and away the best restaurant in CT"
09/26/2010,birna,1.0,"Used to love this steakhouse. This visit was loud, unfriendly, poor service, and the bill was just way too much for an experience this lousy."
09/25/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"we have always loved Michael Jordans, the food is consistently great and the service is impeccable!"
09/24/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,great food and attentive service.
09/19/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Over estimate your reservation as we showed up on time, but our table was not ready for us when we arrived.
All in all though the restaurant was very nice, and the staff pleasant.
The food was spectacular and even after finishing our meal, as other meals were passing by the smell continued to entice the senses and taste buds."
09/19/2010,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"My experience at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse was awful. I cant even speak for the food. I made a reservation, and showed up on time for the reservation.
I was told by the snarky maitre d' that it would be a while before I could be seated.
No problem. I could wait a little bit, even with having RESERVATIONS.
But after 40 minutes of not being seated. We saw a group come in without reservations and get a table immediately. My wife and I, (along with the other unfortunate people in ""line"") took exception to this. Not wanting to wait until 10 pm to be seated for and 8 pm reservation, we left.
Horrible experience, and a birthday ruined."
09/18/2010,Oprahny,4.0,Food was excellent. Go out of my way to make my reservations well in advance of my trips to Mohegan Sun to make sure we get a reservation.
09/17/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"I would normally be highly suspicious of a steak bar donning a celebrity name in a Casino. But this place won me over. The food was incredibly good, the service attentive and light-handed, and the look and feel of the restaurant pleasant. The star, however, was the food. Much better than I would have thought. But it comes at a price: it's a pretty expensive place, though in my mind worth it."
09/11/2010,5052,2.0,"Not a great meal as one would expect. the steak was undercooked and when it came back it was covered in the sauce it had been re-cooked in. The only taste was of the sauce. The baked potato was also overcooked. The skin as well as the inside was hard almost like it had been cooked, sitting, and then heated up before serving.. I don't think we will return."
09/11/2010,pacmangolf,5.0,"An OUTSTANDING experience! Service was GREAT. We had an early reservation because we were attending an 8pm show and didn't want to be rushed. We arrived at 530pm for our reservation and we seated promptly. The waitstaff took care of our every need. After drinks we had the crab cake appitizer. To call this MONSTER an appitizer or even a crab cake is doing it an injustice...IT IS HUGE and I could not find ANY filler, and the taste, TO DIE FOR, THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD ANYWHERE. Onto dinner, both had the fillet, one 10oz special served over grilled polenta with 2 grilled shrimp and the other a 7oz version. Both done med rare and done PERFECTLY...melt in your mouth GREATNESS!!! Creme Bruele and Ammoretta on the rocks and onto the show+++++"
09/10/2010,JERRYD,5.0,"one of the best overall restaurants out there. It is in a casino. On this night we were going to a show, however I would go there just to dine in this restaurant. Anyone thinking of going it is a must try you'll be glad you did."
09/10/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Service was great and we really enjoyed the food.
09/09/2010,ReneeC,4.0,The food was excellent and the service was very good. The restaurant is very noisy. The music was to loud especially for a place that is dimly lit (which in my mind is trying to promote a romantic atmostphere). It is very hard to talk because of the noise level.
09/06/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The steak was amazing. Mushrooms were amazing... The new Mac & Cheese was amazing. Would highly recommend it for all who are looking for a great dinner.

Word of advise- SHARE EVERYTHING b/c you get a tun of food."
08/29/2010,LittleBird,3.0,"Just  ""OK"" !  Kinda riding on the Casino..........."
08/27/2010,JCrowley,5.0,We had a wonderful time. Service was exceptional. Having a booth made it very private.
08/27/2010,James,5.0,MK is probably our favorite place in Mohegan Sun. The food is excellent. The service is great. The atmosphere is really good. And the noise level is great for having a conversation without having to scream. The garlic bread is to kill for. Steaks and fish offerings were wonderful and portions were large. We have tried all of the restaurants in the casino and this is our favorite.
08/25/2010,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"felt as though we were rushed. it was a wed. night, fairly crowded, but appetizers came out as though they had been waiting for us to order them as well as dinner. i ould expect a little more laid back approach for the money being spent."
08/22/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Excellent as usual! We just love the steaks and the sides. Never had a bad meal here.
08/21/2010,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Food was very good however we were in ""sticker shock"" when we saw the prices on the menu. No wonder the restaurant was almost empty on a Saturday Night Very expensive"
08/20/2010,Csef,4.0,"The food was good and the service was prompt and attentive. However, it is a noisy restaurant and it is pricey."
08/20/2010,BirthdayDiner,5.0,"Everything about Michael Jordan's restaurant at Mohegan Sun is elegant and efficient. The diners were my mother and father and two other friends. Wait staff was prompt but not imposing. Food was very good. The dinner was for my mom, on her birthday. I had arranged dessert with the manager prior in the week to ensure there was a variety of tasty desserts for mom on her day, but with enough to share with everyone. The Baked Alaska and Coconut cake were most talked about. MJ's steakhouse is one that I know I will go back to for its consistent high quality of food and staff."
08/17/2010,rogers,4.0,"was very good, great steaks and veal chop"
08/14/2010,Diner,5.0,"We were seated in a booth that was made private with curtains on each side. It was a very romantic setting for our anniversary dinner. The service was great - prompt, good recommendations, courteous. Food was amazing from the garlic bread to the creamed corn to the perfectly cooked tender filet mignon steaks."
08/13/2010,KarlaB,4.0,"The rack of lamb was excellant--the fries were OUT OF THIS WORLD- and I don't usually care to order fries at a nice restaurant, but they came highly recommended and did not disappoint!!!."
08/12/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Very attentive service, not rushed at any time. Beef is certainly top quality, better than I expected. Will definitely be back."
08/07/2010,Jacks,4.0,"The garlic bread is to die for!! Filet Mignon, OMG w/Lobster mash potatoes!!"
08/06/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great restaurant...in a great resort
08/01/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"A noisy restaurant, busy and for a good reason. The steak I had was the best I've ever eaten!! I've been to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse in Florida, Teller's on Long Island, and few local places, but this was just as good as Ruth's and much better than Teller's. I also had the mac and cheese with prosciutto and peas, and I thought it was just OK, though my wife loved it. The onion rings seemed to be from a frozen package-high quality, but I expected something better. In fact I've had better onion rings at a local diner. The drinks were very good, as well as the service, both at the bar and the table. It was definitely worth the money."
08/01/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food itself was the best which is on top of my list when I eat at a restaurant. But the decor and attention to detail was also very visible and interesting to see. Will definitely consider going back on a special date my birthday.
07/31/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"a little slow with the drink order when we first arrived, but great after that"
07/31/2010,NeilJ,5.0,Everything was great. We were seated without delay. We were attending a function and everything was perfectly timed. The steak is the best and the mashed potatoes with lobsters is the best. Great job.
07/31/2010,AliS,5.0,"I went to have dinner with my husband on a saturday night. We had a great time. Service was excelent, and the food was soo good!!! From apetizer(garlic bread with blue cheese), to main course (steak of course) to dessert (hot choc cake)every thing was perfect and they have a good wine selection too. It is a little expensive, but worth every penny."
07/31/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We had an unbelievable time, the service was top notch (being a waitress for 20+ years, I'm critical), they were very attentive, great service, food was unreal and atmosphere was wonderfully romantic. We were VERY happy!!"
07/31/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Service with a smile...knowledgeable wait staff and exceptional food. My fourth time coming here and it never disappoints. From appitizer to desert, it definitely is a treat. Great for special occassions or a night out with friends and family"
07/27/2010,Robbass6,4.0,It was very good food had a lot to choose from also liked that some of the steak offerings came in different sizes to please everyones appitite
07/24/2010,pacmangolf,2.0,VERY UNHAPPY with the way we were greated and made to wait for our reservation. There were AT LEAST TEN tables empty when we got there and they made us wait about 20 minutes in the hope of selling extra drinks. I EXPECTED MORE IN YOU...VERY UNHAPPY about this beginning. FILET WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD.
07/23/2010,BrianN,4.0,Great restaurant with a good menu. Would have like to have seen a better steak selection that didn't include so many sauces. I highly recommend the Wagyu beef steak. A bit pricey but definately worth it.
07/22/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The food here is amazing. The steak is cooked perfectly, and the side dishes are beautifully done. The staff are incredibly attentive."
07/21/2010,DavidH,4.0,"Food as always is exceptional. However, if you are in a hurry or come in at a time where many diners are vying for service, it sometimes is less than adequate. Of course, my perception of service is defined by what I have to do (attending a concert and need to be out by a certain time) so I guess if you have a leisurely dining experience planned, this is a venue you should seriously consider."
07/19/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The service was excellent. The food was delicious. We were seated on time. Michael Jordan's is our favorite restaurant.
07/17/2010,WilliamK,4.0,Extremely noisy. Unable to conduct a simple conversation without yelling. Noisy to the point of discomfort occasionally. Food and service very good but very pricey.
07/17/2010,MikeB,4.0,"Restaurant service and food was very good, but the noise level was very high and difficult to have a discussion."
07/16/2010,Palbe,5.0,Outstanding food and service!!! Worth every penny.
07/12/2010,DDean,4.0,I am not particularly fond of steak (just went there because my husband loves it). But this was one of the best steaks I ever ate. Nice place and not as expensive as I thought it would be. A pleasant surprise all the way around.
07/10/2010,Stefano,3.0,"Food and service was the usual Michael Jordan quality which has always been very nice. Sadly, the design of the restaurant is VERY noisy always....... and this DOES detract greatly from the dining experience
I was disappointed that a moderately priced bottle of Champagne was unavailable. The substitute California sparkling wine was simply AWFUL!"
07/09/2010,WayneE,3.0,"Celebrated our 10 anniversary at MJ Steakhouse. Food was good, however, I felt the prices were very high. I've eaten at numerous fine dine steakhouses and felt that Michael Jordan's Steakhouse came up a little short. The resturant had a great style and ambiance, however, it was extremely loud due to it's open layout."
07/06/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"There wer 4 of us in our party. We asked for Michael to be our server when I made the reservation. He is, by far, the best they have there. We have had several other servers who do not compare. Michael is always on top of things, is quick to check back and correct any issues that may occur. We had salad and lobster chowder for apps; both were wonderful. For our meals, we had 2 orders of scallops, NY strip and Halibut. The fish was a little undercooked but Michael made it right in no time. For sides, we ordered the potatoes and corn. The spicy corn is very good with a nice kick."
07/04/2010,QuincyBoolum,3.0,"Told the waiter we had tickets for the show in the Arena at the hotel. He thanked me and said he'd make sure things were paced appropriately. Well, he didn't. He pretty much abandoned us and we had to get another waiter's attention to get the check when we saw we were already late for the show.

The place was also a bit too loud for folks at table for 8 to hear each other across the table.

As for the food, people who had the steak said it was very good. I had an under-seasoned rack of lamb, cooked medium."
07/04/2010,FranP,3.0,The steaks were very good. Salad and sides could have been better. Salad dressing was watery with no taste. Hit chocolate desert was very ordinary. Dissapointing compared to our last visit.
07/03/2010,TomM,4.0,"Visited MJ's prior to seeing Michael buble in concert. Do not understand some of the negative reviews. Had a half bottle of Justin cab and my wife had a glass of Veuve Champagne. For apps we tried the garlic bread fondue. Excellent, I had a dozen clams on the half shell which were fresh. We split a Ceasar Salad. This was the only negative it could of used a bit more dressing. My wife had the petite filet cooked to perfection at rare. I had the Ny strip mid rare. We split 2 sides. Our waiter was knowledgeable and paced us slowly prior to the show. Service was attentive without being obtrusive. Overall rating 4 stars. Steaks not as good as Mortons or NYC steakhouses but on par for CT. Good Job To Mj staff!!"
07/02/2010,SarahR,5.0,"We had dinner at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse before the Michael Buble' concert, July 2nd.
It was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! The garlic bread (with blue cheese fondue) is an incredible,
mouth watering starter. Steaks were cooked to perfection, insanely tender. The roasted
chicken (practically the entire bird-huge!)was the juiciest ever, and my 10 year old
daughter could'nt get enough of the mac n cheese carbonara-not your average mac n cheese.
If you didn't exceed your limit, and are a peanut butter fan, the chocolate peanut butter ""kit kat"" bars are sensational.
With its dimly lit ambience - and uptown vibe, this restaurant is five star/above par. Not to mention our waiter was adorable!! Thanks Mr. Jordan."
06/30/2010,sylvester,4.0,"service was excellent, however, a bit disappointed in the meal"
06/25/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,In my opinion Michael Jordan's is the BEST restaurant in CT... and that includes all of the state.
06/21/2010,DaresaG,3.0,"My overall experience was good. I would not recommend this restaurant for a special occasion because they will not acknowledge it. We went there with two other couples (6) and the bill was over $400, and no mention of our wedding anniversary as noted on the reservation. The class of this steakhouse is not on par with a Morton's or Ruth Chris which would never overlook a special occassion."
06/18/2010,OpenTable Diner,2.0,The food was a major disappointment. Our waiter was very nice and we ordered what he said the fabulous....it certainly was not!!!
06/13/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Although we found the menu to be somewhat pricey, particularly with same being a' la carte, the quality of food and subsequent service thereof was outstanding. Our servers were extremely attentive throughout our entire dining experience, and genuinely made us feel that our patronage was indeed appreciated. As to ambiance, sadly an atmosphere conducive to a wholly pleasurable dining encounter was sorely lacking. Due in part to tables being entirely too close in proximity to one another; the overall mood bore semblance of cafeteria-style seating. This was of notable concern to us based upon the overall incurred expense of the evening."
06/12/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Love eating here. I've never had a bad experience, and everything I've eaten here has been delicious. Would recommend it to anyone."
06/05/2010,maxd,3.0,"restaurant was ""ordinary"". Very pricey. Service was good, however my wine came in a chipped wine glass. The server did not take the opportunity to exceed my expectations. She poured my wine in a new glass and put it in front of me......"
05/29/2010,ChrisS,4.0,GREAT food ! A little expensive but the food is really great ! Would definitely go back again.
05/23/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The meat and fish at Michael Jordan's are fantastic, and so are the desserts. The service is efficient, but can be a bit brusque."
05/22/2010,NanC,5.0,Absolutely the best steak I have ever had!!! The service was fantastic with great wine recommendations by our server. I will definitely go back!
05/22/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Have been to Michael Jordans on several occassions, always have great food and fun. The staff is very friendly and courteous"
05/20/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"It was our wedding anniversary, we were treated like celebrities!! A special
table, very romantic. Excellent service and absolutley delicious food.

What a wonderful evening. They even offered cake and champagne for our
special occassion, I think on the house. We declined since we were tooooo full
from our meal."
05/18/2010,FOODIE,4.0,"The reason we chose this restaurant after viewing the menu on-line was the lobster mashed potatoes. Unfortunately, it was an extreme let-down. The potatoes were hard, not creamy and the few pieces of lobster in the dish were very dry. The wedge blue cheese salad was delicious; the creamed spinach was delicious. We ordered the cowboy steak which was a rib-eye. It came on a plate of chocolate sauce which we asked to have on the side since we had never heard of a steak and chocolate coming together. The waiter forgot. We ate it; the steak was fabulous but the chocolate sauce did not add anything that we enjoyed to the steak; overall, it was a good experience and would probably go again."
05/14/2010,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"The birthday dinner never had a chance to recover. Though the food was good, the service at the front desk left much to be desired. Our waitress was a bit forgetful, but was at least nice. However, the overwhelmingly rude hostess in the front desk managed to ruin the whole night. Not only did she make us wait 30+ minutes for a reservation I made a month in advance, she gave me so much attitude when I inquired about our table after waiting for 20 minutes. Basically told us to sit down and keep quiet. And after all the waiting, she STILL did not get the table right. This was my 3rd time at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse, but I can't say that the service was impeccable at any of my dinners there.  This one sealed the deal. I won't be going back."
05/10/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Food was amazing as always. Only area for improvement.....server did not pack up our leftovers. Just took the plates away and never even asked if we wanted them wrapped up. We assumed she'd be back, but she only returned with the bill"
05/09/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,We went there for our wedding anniversary and as soon as I stepped in restaurant I knew I was going to love it. The lighting was soft and so was the chairs and the wait was not long either! Our drinks were a good size for the price and the food was delicious and there were plenty of leftovers afterwards. We love the garlic bread with the cheese sauce( I dont remember what it is actually called). It is a bit pricey but well worth it. I will be going back again...
05/09/2010,transwood,5.0,"The steaks are incredible; cooked to perfection. We tried the mac and cheese carbonara as a side which was also excellent. Large portions, too."
05/09/2010,BKay,3.0,"A Mother's Day brunch was noted when I made the reservation, but when I got there I was told they did not have a brunch!"
05/09/2010,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"The food was good but I felt we were tricked into spending more money than was necessary. One of the first things our waiter asked us, before we even had a chance to look at the menu, was ""can I bring you guys some garlic bread?"". Of course we said ""Yes Please"" thinking it was complimentary, only to find out when we got the bill that we were charged $9.00 for it! The next thing we were unhappy about was the ""sides"". Two of us ordered Lobster Mashed potatos, which were delicious but it would have been nice to know that the portions were so big that two of us could have shared one. I understand your in business to make money but you should also consider your guests and not try to soak every dime out of us as you can. We will not return."
05/05/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Michael Jordan's was a thrill! From the moment we walked in and were greeted to the end of a very gratifying and scrumptuous meal, we were in the palms of some very caring and professional hands."
05/02/2010,KevinH,3.0,Has been better in the past. Hoping it was just an off night but at the prices they charge they should never have an off night.
05/02/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Food was great, service was great. Good restaurant for special occasions. It's about the only time we can afford to dine there."
04/25/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Went there with a group of girlfriends and the food was spectacular and the service was great. Besides the couple of loud groups of men there shouting it was awesome!
04/25/2010,MonsterRoss,2.0,"Loud, just average food. Definitely not worth the money. I travel and eat out quite a bit this was just an OK experience. You cannot have a conversation in the restaurant as it is so loud. We were yelling at each other. The only reason it is going is because it is at the Casino and has a famous person's name."
04/24/2010,RichardB,5.0,"We were very pleased with our visit to Michael Jordan's Steak House. The food was excellent. The steaks were tender and cooked just the way we ordered them. I thought the truffle fries were a little saltier and garlicier than I would have liked but the onion rings were great. Our manhattans were made just the way we ordeered them, also. It was a very good evening overall."
04/23/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Good food, great people I will continue to go here and recommend to everyone I know"
04/23/2010,OpenTable Diner,3.0,First visit to Michael Jordan's. Service was less intrusive than Ruth's Chris - which was appreciated. Food was prepared perfectly. Huge portions.
04/21/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,MJ's Steakhouse is my husband's and my favorite place to eat. We especially love going there on special occasions. The food is amazing and the service is often above and beyond. Definitely consider adding a special crust to your steak!
04/21/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Dining experience was excellent!! Seafood Tower a must have!!
04/19/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"My wife and I ate at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse while visiting Mohegan Sun casino. We were on a mini-vacation and wanted to hit a gourmet restaurant or two. We both had the Filet, and it was absolutely amazing. We shared an order of the onion rings, which are plenty for two. We then enjoyed hot chocolate cake and blueberry pie. In all, the food is excellent and the wait staff is very helpful.

I can't wait to return."
04/17/2010,RebG,5.0,Excellent service + great ambiance + phenomenal food = wonderful night out!!
04/16/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Our server's name was Michael and he was just phenomenal. We were acknowledged very quickly and were provided with water; and our glasses were kept filled throughout dinner. Drink service was pretty quick. For appetizers, we ordered the ""Wedge of Lettuce"" and the ""Lobster Chowder""; both were very good and delivered quickly. The Lobster Chowder is delicious but my only complaint was that there was not a lot of lobster meat in the chowder - maybe 3 small pieces. The last time I had the chowder, there was much more meat - probably luck of the ladle. Our perfectly-cooked steaks (NY sirloin and Filet) and sides were awesome. MJ outdoes all other restaurants by asking the guest to check for correct doneness. This is a brilliant practice."
04/15/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Just wonderful place to enjoy a lovely meal. Food is perfect and so is waitstaff.
04/10/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellent meal. We really enjoyed the food and the pace of the meal. Our waiter was top notch.
04/09/2010,Kaiser,4.0,I go to MJs a lot. The farm raised chicken dinner was recently changed -I didnt enjoy the sauce at all and only ate half. Im not a picky eater and really didnt like it.
04/09/2010,Erin,5.0,Thank god we had a reservation...the place was packed! The blue cheese fondue was outstanding and the filet was perfect. We only had an hour to eat before the sow and the waitress was completely accommodating...loved it!
04/04/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"With the exception of the Hostess unprofessional demeaner, our visit was surperb. We had drinks and appretizers, at the Sport' Bar prior to having dinner in the Steakhouse.

We had our fourteen year old daughter. I found both resturants to be children friendly.

The food was excellent!"
04/03/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,I let them know in advance we were there to celebrate my husband's birthday so they gave us a velvet-lined booth with pillows! The steak is the best I've ever tasted and the sides and desserts are delicious too. The service is prompt and accurate I just wish they had come back to refill my water glass.
04/02/2010,Kara,5.0,"Great food and service. We asked for a booth for the two of us in advance through open table, the staff obliged. It definitely made it a more romantic experience (I have been before but not sat in a booth), it definitely cut down on the noise as well. I will definitely return, it was a great experience!!!!"
03/29/2010,KKGG,4.0,"surprisingly good! Expected something average since it was a ""chain"" but its comparable to the nice meals I've had in NYC."
03/27/2010,ElizabethW,4.0,"This may be the 12th time I have dined at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse. We brought friends who were celebrating their wedding anniversary and, as always, MJS did not disappoint. The service and attention to our every need was exemplary.It was Kobe beef and Cabernet all around, which meant a wonderful meal. Looking forward to our 13th, 14th and 15th visits, too."
03/26/2010,DarylS,5.0,Food and service was excellent! A little pricey but I knew that before I went.
03/21/2010,ElPavo,2.0,"Michael Jordon's is a decent steakhouse. The steak quality (the porterhouse for 2) was good. Flavor, smell, and texture. The steak, was not however, nicely charred. My opinion, the steak was good, but not worth the premium price. The sides were fine. But, the seafood (shrimp cocktail) was awful. It had a strong seafood taste, and the cocktail sauce was bland.

For the premium New York City price that I paid for a casino restaurant, I would spend my money elsewhere."
03/21/2010,Chief,5.0,"Our dining experience was outstanding. The only complaint was the noise level in the room, very hard to carry on a conversation across the table."
03/16/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Nice place for an intimate dinner for two. Must request a Booth.
03/14/2010,KevinR,4.0,"Everything was great except for the music. It was too loud and had a repetitive drumming noise like Africa or something, it was very annoying. The staff, service and food was perfect."
03/13/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We were seated right away. The servers were very pleasant and recommended things for us to try. The food was excellent.They didn't rush us out.We were there for our anniversay, they took a photo for us."
03/12/2010,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"As a Steak house..does not compare to a Flemings or a Mortons. But as it is the casino, will continue to do well despite the average food. My advice would be to go to the Michael Jordan’s 23.sportcafe next door for equal quality food and better atmosphere."
03/12/2010,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"We have dined here before for special occasions. Most recently we dined here because we liked the restaurant at our previous visits. The menu has changed(not for the better-sides have changed, not all steak is prime), the martini I ordered was not as listed on the menu, the service was just ""ok"" at best. For the prices you are paying, I expect more. My husband and I would have rather eaten at Summer Shack based on this most recent experience. We will not be returning."
03/08/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,The perfect place to spend my anniversary.
03/06/2010,Mickey,5.0,Excellent! Try the roasted chicken and gorganzola bread.
03/05/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"We had a pleasurable dining experience and would recommend it to our friends. The only constructive comment would be to have the waitstaff check on the tables more often and not pull away dishes until all people at table are done eating. To leave one person with a dinner dish while 3 others are being pulled away makes the 4th person feel like they have to stop. For the price of dinner, we should be allowed to eat as slow or fast as we like."
02/28/2010,Mikethecop,5.0,"After a brief delay (15 mins), we got sat at 745pm...reservation was for 730. No biggie. The place was sold out/packed...and yet we still had the one on one service that I have heard people rave about. I enjoyed the Delmonico Steak with a balsamic-ginger demi-glaze and it was incredible! The wine list was extensive...and expensive...lol. Don't plan on going to Jordan's without spending at least $80 per person. Overall, I was very pleased and will be returning soon!"
02/28/2010,SeaGirl,3.0,"We were seated in front of the kitchen and it was extremely noisy. The lighting was horrible. It was so dim, we could hardly read our menu. The food was very good though."
02/26/2010,mjw67,5.0,Excellent meal! Highly recommend the garlic bread/fundu cheese appetizer.
02/21/2010,Cedar9393,2.0,The food was ok but very overpriced. The restaurant was too loud and seating was too close. For the money paid I would much rather go to a Mortons. Very disappointed.
02/21/2010,BobH,4.0,"Good as usual. We were seated upon arrival. It is very active and busy in this casino location. Not for the quiet romantics. Martini was fabulous. Cesaer salad was seasoned just right. Beef (filet) was tender and cooked perfectly. The chicken was especially ejoyable. Shared a 1+ pound baked potato & mushrooms. We were stuffed. No room for coffee or dessert. When at Mohegian Sun, splurge & go to MJ's."
02/20/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Friday evening - Very busy and very noisy. Will go back on a week night and hope it is less hectic.
02/19/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Our dining experience was fabulous. The food was perfection, and I'm sure that if it somehow fell short of expectations, the wait staff would have rectified that. Our server was personable, but not intrusive. We were not rushed, but instead allowed to have a leisurely dinner. Not only would I recommend this restaurant to friends and family, I would visit it again."
02/18/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The restaurant was too dark. They need to lighten it up a bit in there so we can see the menus, etc. Besides that, the service was excellent and the food, of course, was excellent as well."
02/18/2010,Tinak,4.0,"Great restaurant, great food. Highly recommended."
02/17/2010,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"The food is ok. The garlic bread starter is out of this world and the mashed potatoes are ample and tasty. The steak was fair, certainly not the ""wow"" that should have happened at a place like this. What is totally off putting is the price of the wine list. They tried to pawn off a $24 retail bottle of Steele Pinot Noir as a $75 SPECIAL that they usually sell for $150. They have multiple other instances on their list where they mark up normal wines at 3 to 4 times their single bottle retail cost. When asked about it, the manager told me I was crazy and could not get the wine at the retail price I said I could. I defy any reader to not be able to get it, perhaps even for less. Arrogance, high prices and ok food are a bad combination."
02/17/2010,DAVIDF,5.0,"My fiancee and I tried the ""fixed-price"" option and the food was superb, including the sorbet desert. My fiancee did not like the pinot grigio wine she had, but my pinot noirwas fine. We dine here about once every month or two, and it is always excellent."
02/16/2010,BonniePez,4.0,"When entertaining professional guests, Michael Jordan's is my ""go-to-impress"" venue. Serving staff is always knowledgable and the food impecable. A sure bet for a wonderful dining experience."
02/16/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,My wife and i celebrated our anniversary at MJ and it was awesome. i would recommend the booth for romantic settings!
02/15/2010,TimF,2.0,"All of the food was luke warm. The desert was excelent. May go back, but wouldn't bet on it."
02/15/2010,Sweeneyct,2.0,"It's a steakhouse, however, I had to send my filet back 3 times! Medium well is how I ordered it cooked, it was not pink, it was red/rare. It was still rare the 2nd time around. Finally, the 3rd time it was good."
02/14/2010,Jeanne,4.0,"Service was slow, soup was cold and we seemed to be forgotten. But the waiter tried very hard to make up for the mistakes. It was Valentine's day, if it was any other day, I expect that this would not have happened."
02/14/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Food was good and service was great. Prices are over the top for the food.
02/14/2010,Whftdfoodie,4.0,"Micheal Jordan's resturant is inside the Mohegan Sun Resort Casino. It is as you expect...expensive. However, as a occasional treat it is the right choice. The service was the best, food cooked just right and the atmosphere is casual but sophisticated. Iwill absolutly return as soon as I build up my ""mad money"" account."
02/14/2010,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"Food was extremely bland for the price. We had to order all sides, which I understand you normally do at higher end restaurants....but even the sides were not good. The fries were so salty, not even the salt lovers ate them. My steak; which was supposed to be topped with gorgonzola.. had literally 6 tiny pieces of gorgonzola on it. Truely dissapointed and enjoyed the other Michael Jordan establishment ""Sol Toro"" 100% better."
02/14/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,terrific dining experience. garlic bread and blue cheese fondue is a must have
02/14/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,This was our first time at Michael Jordan's. It was an awesome experience. The food was great and the atomsphere was awesome...Will definitely be back.
02/14/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The place was great, but we went for a romantic Valentine's Day dinner and were seated in the font by the noisy bar scene. The back area looks much more cozy & elegant (more spread out and more quiet) than our location. The steak was amazing, I would rate 8/10 with delicious garlic cheese bread (highly recommend that!). Since it's located in the Casino, I recommend going ONLY if you WIN big:)"
02/13/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Our reservation was right on time, no wait, taken directly to our table. Both waiter and staff introduced themselves, very pleasant. Our waiter was very knowledgable and the food was wonderful. Can't wait for our next vist to MJ's steakhouse!!"
02/10/2010,DennisC,2.0,"Apps ,tartare- not flavored well some kind of mustard base ,shrimp/crab cocktail shrimp sauce bland , crab very salty, tasteless. Tuna and delmonio steak came cold ,tuna ok steak tough and not seasoned well, didn't like sauce. Chef needs to tase food . We are never complainers but this was a big dissapointment.we ate there 2/9/10 8:00. Moniqe our waitress not very good.sorry Micheal"
02/09/2010,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"My family and I went to the restaurant for my daughter's 21st birthday. I had sent a request ahead of time for a birthday cake. We got there on time for our reservation, and being that it was a Monday night we were seated immediately.

The food is very expensive!, and all items are ala carte. Therefore for a dinner for four people, with garlic bread as the only added appetizer the bill was $252.00, that was no wine, but did include two mixed drinks.

The steaks were mediocre, the swordfish was good, and the rack of lamb was horrible! Also, the portions were average except for the caesar salad and baked potatoes. Those were good size and could be shared. Overall, the experience was very disappointing. AND, no birthday cake!"
02/06/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"10th time there. Always cosistant, Always good. Good company,good time great food."
02/05/2010,Sandy1967,4.0,Steaks were good but not outstanding and they should be based on the prices charged. I will stick to the cafe from now on.
02/05/2010,KristenG,4.0,This was our first time to the MJ Steakhouse....it was a bit pricey but well worth it. The meal was excellent down to the basic salad with vinegarette....we will definately go back. Service was excellent.
02/05/2010,Larry,3.0,"The food was very good as expected. The service lacked. We both felt the there wasn't the level of service deserved in a restaurant charging these prices. Too many people dressed in jeans and t-shirts when it specifically states ""Business Casual""."
01/31/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Michael Jordon's consistently provides excellent, superb quality food. It is a special ocasion place for us and we have never been disappointed."
01/31/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The hostess and servers were tremendous. The waitress was friendly, courteous and attentive to our every need. We had a wonderful time. Garlic bread is best around!!"
01/29/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"All was excellent, we have been there several times and enjoy everything."
01/24/2010,RobertS,3.0,Large impersonal venue that handles the crowds well. Very noisy. Food very good. Side dishes were delivered well after entrees. Needs a little better coordination. Don't show up without reservation on saturday night. We had one and were seated within 15 mn
01/17/2010,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"Very overpriced for the quality of the steak..Food was not steaming hot.Spinach had more
breadcrumbs than spinach..Steak was rubbery..Wine was poured cheaply into a small carafe
and filled only halfway up.."
01/17/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Unfortunately, there isn't an option to give 6 stars for service, because that is what this restaurant and its employees deserve."
01/15/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Other then when dinning for two that give you zero privacy what a great place.
01/10/2010,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The food was excellent however we had a reservation which was made on open table with michaels jordans steakhouse and we ended up waiting a half hour after our scheduled reservation..Which may have been alright if all the tables were full but when we were getting seated,there were at least ten open tables. There were many couples with reservations waiting just like us and my advice is to keep checking in with the hostess every five minutes because those people got seated first"
01/09/2010,SusanH,5.0,"This is the second time we have eaten there. The first being many years ago. The food is very good. My husband and I had steaks, which were cooked perfectly. The staff was very attentive without being intrusive. She even gave me extra wonton chips for my tuna tartare, which was also excellent. The dessert was very good also. The portions are just right. We didn't feel overwhelmed by the end of the meal. It is not an inexpensive meal; but great for a special occasion splurge. Without drinks, our meal was over $100. We would definitely go again."
01/03/2010,LaurenB,4.0,The lobster mashed potatoes were the best potatoes I have ever had. Loved them! Making reservations on OpenTable.com was great and I put in a special request that was fulfilled. Thank you to Michael Jordan's for sending a dessert with candle to our table to celebrate my husband's birthday. It was a great surprise to him and he couldn't figure out how the waitress knew it was his birthday.
01/03/2010,ANNEMARIES,4.0,"Excellent meal Terrific steak done perfectly ...
The only complaint is teh ""Hard Sell"" waiters helpers are scripted...to sell water, more drinks push push wine and dessert...Seemed very scripted...I think MJ has enough money just give me a menu, tell me if there are specials...quit the scripted push..i'm not at the cheesecake factory!!!"
01/01/2010,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellent meal
01/01/2010,Reviewing4u,3.0,"The steaks are a great size and they were cooked perfectly. The sides were ok...not fantastic. We got a lobster mashed potatoes and creamed spinich, they were kind of bland. The lobster mashed potatoes were as basic as mashed pototates except with a $12 price tag. The garlic bread was tasty but VERY heavy. I suggest you go there with a large appetite.

Our waitress wasn't very personable and seemed to be rushing us, but this was on New Years Eve, so forgiveable :)"
01/01/2010,jazzyjoz,4.0,We enjoyed a wonderful meal and were even sat early! The service was so-so.
12/31/2009,Weeksie,4.0,"Not a big fan of the bench style seating we were given, but the meal and our service from Leah was amazing. From the generous crab cake to the Baked Alaska the meal was exceptional."
12/26/2009,CINDYG,5.0,We had a great dining experience at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse. I would definitely visit there again for a special occasion.
12/25/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food was fabulous and we always like dining there when we can. We brought our son for the first time and he commented that his steak was the best he has ever had.
12/24/2009,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Food was superb! Service was great! A bit overpriced, but if you can afford it; try it!"
12/18/2009,JanaC,3.0,"It was a nice meal before a nice concert. I liked being able to make my reservation online, that was handy. It was a little overpriced but I guess given where it is..."
12/17/2009,DianeB,2.0,"The waitress was attentive and wanted to be sure everything served was to our liking (esp. steaks cooked correctly) as soon as the dishes were brought to the table.
This restaurant is on the second floor of a Casino that allows smoking. we noticed the stale smell of cigarrette smoke in this restaurant. (we were all non-smokers and are sensitive the the smell.) This was a turn-off.The tables for a party of 4 are very small also. I ordered the smaller filet mignon and it was really very tiny, but fortunately tender. It was supposed to be 6 oz. but there was not much on the plate. My husband had a Kobie beef steak and there were pieces of sinew running thoughout. We will not go again. Overpriced for what you get and not much of it."
12/11/2009,ribeyelover,1.0,"make sure you get your steaks naked, or with the chocolate sauce(YUK) on the side, way too much stuff on the steaks, it ruined our $49 cowboy steaks, we had to take them to go and wash them clean the next day to eat them at home !!! ruth's chris is by far the best steak house, will never go to michael jordan's again !"
12/10/2009,Linda377,5.0,We had a wonderful experience at this restaurant. The food was great as was the service.
12/06/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We have been to MJ's many times, and have yet to be disappointed. This visit proved once again that superior food, wine, and service can always be expected while dining here. The staff went out of their way to ensure that our evening was pleasurable in every way. Our meals were prepared exactly as we requested, and they tasted like they were made just for us. I also found an outstanding new wine from the fine wine list."
12/05/2009,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Great food. Great service. Price not so great but we were expecting that. This was for a special occation and we had a great time. The wait staff were on the top of their game.
12/04/2009,JeanC,5.0,"As ever, it was a wonderful experince dining at Muchael Jordan's. The staff is attentive but not overbearing. The food cooked to perfection!"
11/26/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food was great and our server Stacey was outstanding. It was a bit too noisy.
11/24/2009,WendyB,4.0,"We eat early, so the place is quiet and the service terrific. Can't say what it's like later when they are surely more crowded. The steaks and sides are excellent. We go at least once a year and always enjoy the meal."
11/23/2009,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"We asked for our steak cooked medium well, and they were well done. Not the end of the world, but my steak has gristle in it. When you pay this much for a meal, you should not have a steak with fat or gristle. This was for an 80th birthday dinner, and although special instructions were left, nothing was mentioned. Based on this experience, I would pass this up and dine at J. Gilbert's in Glastonbury. The food is always reasonably priced and excellent."
11/23/2009,Ednasgldphish,4.0,Steak was slightly over cooked (asked for medium and received medium well +) however the filet with truffled potato salad was superb. Friendly and attentive service.
11/21/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The dining experience at Michael Jordan's was fantastic. First rate food and service on a very busy night. I'm looking forward to returning soon.
11/21/2009,Sdk12345,4.0,we always enjoy our meal at michael jordan's at mohegan sun. the service and food are consistent. our only complaint is that we always have to wait at least 15 minutes beyond our reservation time. we wish we would be seated more promptly.
11/21/2009,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"We had a bad expeience 3 years ago at Michael Jordon's Steak House and wanted to give it a second try during our visit last weekend.
We had ordered their favorite steak Kansas City Cut without any glaze no salt on it. It was supposed to be the best without much fat on it. We also ordered scallops without any salt in them due to a health issue(BP) and two salads and side dishes.
The food arrived and the steak had both glaze and salt on it. It was fatty and had full of nerves on it. The scallops had salt on them!
We had complained and and the waiter went back in to tell the manager. They did not do anything but gave us the bill. The waiter apologized for the bad expeirence. He was nice but NOT THE RESTURANT. WHAT A BAD DINING EXPERIENCE"
11/18/2009,DebhraB,5.0,"When dining we do not like to be rushed, it is more enjoyable when given the time to enjoy each course with time between each. Our server did just this. The food was great, our steaks were tender and cooked as we ordered. We would return."
11/18/2009,Niceview,5.0,"We had a wonderful table which just added to the whole evening. We were seated in a private booth so even though the restaurant was busy we were quietly enjoying our dinner.
The service was attentive but not intrusive and the food was delicious. We'd definitely go back again."
11/15/2009,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Very nice. Food was great ambiance was very nice.
11/14/2009,Sross,5.0,It's a favorite spot for my wife and I.
11/14/2009,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"It was the first time visiting Michael Jordan's Steakhouse. We were seated promptly, and courteously. We had excellent service and the food was good. Our waiter was very helpful with the menu. We would return and would recommend it to family and friends. Thank-you"
11/11/2009,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Our experience was wonderful. The food was great and the service was outstanding. The only negative thing was how busy and loud it was that night. We were not upset by it, noise is to be expected when a restaurant is full. We will most certainly be back soon!"
11/08/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food was delicious & we had a great time!
11/08/2009,jan1,4.0,"food service great but for 930 reservation, didnt get seated until after 10"
11/08/2009,DesTiny,2.0,"I have wanted to go to MJs for years, but this first dinner was quite disappointing. Filet was a bit tough, and nothing special. Drinks were OK, but we found an extra drink we didn't purchase on our bill. Also, we felt quite a bit rushed...no sooner did we order then came the appetizer, salads and meals. Finally, the 'featured' wine was not on sale, but when I asked the server he told me the restaurant got a discount price..how nice for them. We won't be returning."
11/07/2009,Brenda,4.0,"NOTE TO RESTAURANT (THE SPACE BELOW WON'T TAKE IT)
We were celebrating a 55th and 21st birthday and saved MJ's Steakhouse for this very special occasion having previously enjoyed the cafe. We are NOT casino goers.
The service was excellent - the sides were absolutely incredible (lobster mashed, truffle oil fries, and seasonal vegies). The steaks were just --okay. Overall, we found the experience to be overpriced and over-rated. Thank you for the memory, but we probably won't return given the distance (40 miles). We would, however, recommend it to others to try."
11/05/2009,PeggyD,3.0,We were a bit disappointed as we have dined here in the past but the steaks that night were not up to expectations. The beet salad was rather ordinary. The fries and corn were terrific though.
11/05/2009,Moluvfood,4.0,The experience was wonderful. i will recommend this restaurant to my friend & family.
10/31/2009,ShelleyH,4.0,"This was the second time we ate at MJ's at Mohegan Sun. The first time we had a cozy banquette table in the back of the restaurant, which was lovely. This time we were right by the serving line and bar and by large tables of guys. We definitely didn't like the table and if we return will ask for a table like we had last time. We thought the food was very good, but again, didn't think the desserts were as tasty as they should be. Overall, though, it's a nice experience."
10/31/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Probably the best Filet Mignon I have every had and that says a lot
10/30/2009,cate,5.0,"The salad, steaks and sides were fabulous. every one at dinner was very satisfied and content. The dessert disappointed, we got the six small desserts and they came in little pudding cups and tasted like they were made hours before and sat in the fridge. It did not dampen our experience and we would go back again, very soon."
10/29/2009,transwood,4.0,"This was our third visit. Food always very good and service good too. The steaks are always prepared perfectly. The hostess wanted to seat us next to the kitchen when the
restaurant was only 1/4 full. After some haggling we got a good table. We had reservations."
10/24/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Michael Jordan's Steakhouse is wonderful. The food and service are phenomenal. We have never had a bad experience and it has become our favorite place to eat at Mohegan Sun.
10/24/2009,Stella,4.0,"The garlic bread with fondue sauce was amazing. The ceasar salad was a little plain, could use a sharper cheese and more garlic in dressing. The filet mignon was delicious but the potatoes were a little plain. My husband's delmonico was fantastic, melt in your mouth delicious. The grilled corn was sweet yet spicy which was very good. The kit kat bars were yummy."
10/24/2009,AnthonyD,5.0,Wait staff was attentive and couteous. Food was cooked to perfection. The four of us ordered smaller cuts and they were still correctly cooked medium. Staff held our table for 30 minutes as we were late arriving due to traffic. All around good experience. Extensive wine list is a bit pricey though.
10/18/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"To whom it may concern,
The service and the dinner was great. We always know what we want, everything was cooked to are liking. But we didn't have room for dessert"
10/17/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,food was great ! The side portions were huge.
10/17/2009,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"We dine here every so often but it is too expensive to do so more frequently...unless you win gambling that night! Dinner with drinks will be around $100 per person if you're conservative...otherwise it will get much more pricey.

The atmosphere appears romantic from the outside but it is a sports bar at heart as flat screen line the walls, and let's not forget, we are in Michael Jordan's restaurant afterall.

If you're looking for a special night out (birthdays, anniversary, first date, etc), then this is your place. For a regular night out, the Michael Jordan Cafe has a bigger (better) menu and is much more reasonable."
10/12/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Food was delicious and plentiful. Very fresh tuna steak, with a delicatable crisp
fried rice cake shows this is more than a steakhouse. Kalamata olive bread was a real treat. Staff was knowlegable and friendly. Treated us to free champagne because it was our anniversary."
10/10/2009,TrishG,5.0,All was great--the garlic bread with blue cheese fondue is out of this world. Wonderful service. Booths are the best as there can be some loud tables and this removes you a bit.
10/09/2009,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Food was good, but quite expensive. We heard you can get the same menu for 1/2 the price at the Sports Bar which is right next to the restaurant. Dinner for 2, with an appetizer, main course and side dish as well as the least expensive bottle of wine came to $180.00 + tip."
10/04/2009,CherylP,2.0,Had to wait for table and had to wait for waiter to come to table. Tomato salad was served with unripe tomatoes that still had the hard part of the tomato on them. Not nice! it was taken off our bill. French fries did not come out with our order and did not think it was worth the price- go next door to the sports cafe.
10/03/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We had an incredible meal at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse. The food was superb - my husband said his steak was the best he's ever had. The waiter was very attentive, the timing was just right, and we thoroughly enjoyed it!"
10/02/2009,idine,3.0,"The food and service was good. The salads are excellent, as are the sides. Our Waygu steak was not good quality, have had much better elsewhere. Appetizers were better than the entrees."
10/02/2009,JoanA,2.0,The restaurant was very nice - food was of good quality - atmosphere was less than desirable - so very noisy that our party had to just about yell to hear one another - would not go back due to the atmosphere
09/25/2009,Sandy,5.0,"This was probably the best meal (in a very long time) that we have truely enjoyed out in public. Clients were courteous of other clients. The staff were all efficient, courteous, professional and attentive. The food was full of flavor, uniquely presented and cooked exactly as asked."
09/25/2009,UConnFan92,4.0,Our server knew her stuff. Recommended a good wine and the steaks were excellent. I had been there before and will be sure to go again.
09/22/2009,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"The service was awful. Although the restaurant was empty, the service was painfully slow. One of only two entree items was incorrect. Rather than wait however that long that would have taken to correct while the other dinner's entree got cold, we decided to keep the incorrect entree. One would expect the service to improve at that point, however, it just got worse and we felt the waiter was avoiding us (in an empty restaurant) out of embarrassment. Furthermore, the manager never came to the table to apologize or speak to us directly.

The entree and dessert was removed from the bill, but by then the entire experience had been ruined by the bad and painfully slow service."
09/19/2009,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"This is my third time at MJ Rest, each time i return the experience is better than the last, as usual the food is great. Highly recommended for those who wish to have a romantic evening."
09/17/2009,IreneZ,4.0,The dinner for two choice was a good buy. Food was outstanding.
09/07/2009,Mikeswife2009,5.0,"Had 9:30pm reservations post-concert and apparantly so did lots of other people. We had a short wait but getting a drink at the bar helped pass the time. Since it was packed, it was quite noisy but no more than your usual hip place. Luckily for us there were a few tables nestled in a back room where it was much quieter. The service was great and the food even better. If you like blue cheese, the garlic bread is a must! In true Michael Jordan, only the best will do."
09/06/2009,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"Very, very disappointing experience. Having been to Michael Jordan's several times before, my husband wanted to go there to celebrate his birthday. We got a booth as requested and seated promptly,however the experience fell apart from that moment on. We waited for almost 20 minutes before anyone came over to the table to ask if we would like something to drink while we were looking at the menu, then it took them another 15 to 20 minutes to take our order. Once the food was delivered, (by another wait person) our waitress never came over to see if everything was okay - this happened not only through our appetizers and salads, but dinner as well. Needless to say - she was left a 10% tip - to be honest, she didn't even deserve that much."
08/30/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,very good food and great service.
08/30/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Good restaurant, great food and service."
08/29/2009,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"The food and service was very good, however, very loud."
08/27/2009,Tinak,5.0,"This is one of the best steak houses ever. Excellent food, great drink and wine list, service is terrific."
08/22/2009,ShelleyH,3.0,"We celebrated our anniversary at MJ's. We chose the restaurant because Mohegan Sun has a kid's babysitting room, which was perfect for us to get away for a few hours. I'm not a meat eater and can't comment on the meat selections. My husband thought his NY strip was good, but not as good as other steakhouses. I ate sides and wasn't wowed by any of them. I had the MJ Special drink and it was not good at all. We did enjoy a free chocolate cake dessert for our anniversary. We thought it was good for free, but didn't think it was the most delicious chocolate cake we've ever had. We thought the service was very good."
08/21/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"I have to say that each and every time I visit MJ's that I am completely happy, more importantly, my WIFE is happy. Anytime we go to a show at the Mohegan Sun we always make MJ's a part of our evening and will continue to do so, I always recommend this restaurant to everyone I know when visiting Mohegan Sun. Outstanding food, always enough to fill you up."
08/15/2009,Tony,2.0,"For a high-end (expensive) steak house, Michael Jordan's is disappointing. The atmosphere is too loud and the wood tables (no table cloths) are too casual. The crab cake appetizer had a strong fishy taste. The filet mignon was tough and was covered in a sauce I did not like. The only food I enjoyed was the heirloom tomato and watermelon salad, which was fresh and tasty."
08/14/2009,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"My fiancee and I had a great experience. The lump crab cake was outstanding (big chunks of fresh crab delicately made). We both had steaks for dinner (kobe skirt steak and 10oz NY strip). The strip was amazing (that special rub they put on it is something else) and the kobe skirt steak was good (recomend medium on the cut). We also had a side of fresh cut fries drizzled with truffle oil... so good!
Ended the evening with coffee and dessert. Left with a smile our face and a full belly."
08/11/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Michael Jordan's was excellent as always! Everything was first class.
08/08/2009,NancyB,5.0,Incredible food. Well worth the trip.
08/08/2009,Steve,4.0,Had a great meal with surprise dessert for our anniversity. Good food and service
08/08/2009,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Delicious food, expensive, noisy, enjoyable nonetheless"
08/08/2009,Sdk12345,4.0,We are never disappointed when we dine at Michael Jordan's. The steaks are superb as is the rest of the menu. Let's not forget the wine list that we always enjoy. We find that the food is always consistent...consistently delicious!
08/02/2009,OpenTable Diner,4.0,The food was amazing. Absolutely delicious!!!!!!! Can't wait to visit again !!!
07/25/2009,OpenTable Diner,2.0,I usually LOVE Michael Jordans. But the steak this time was AWFUL! I mean a really bad cut of meat that they try to hide with some funky rub. Not sure of they changed chefs or they are just going with cheaper meat to keep the same profit. But when the tab is $300 for two - one really does not expect the food to be of this caliber! Really very disappointing. Would not return.
07/23/2009,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The crab cake was outstanding! Well worth the price. Our filets were cooked to our liking and the mushroom and mashed potato sides were great. Our dessert (hot chocolate cake) was the best way to end the meal. Our servers were attentive and professional, but we felt slightly rushed. It was clear that they wanted to turn the table asap."
07/19/2009,PatriciaM,5.0,We had a great dinner at Michael Jordans. The staff was so wonderful to our 6 year old daughter...made the night very special for her.
07/18/2009,Nope,4.0,I was very impressed! My scallops were so delicious-was hoping for a few more! Waitstaff was efficient and very friendly. Every dish that came to the table was noteworthy! I would definitley return!
07/17/2009,Family,3.0,"Before we ordered, the waiter came by every two minutes. Once we ordered, it was difficult to get his attention - especially when we wanted an additional drink. The steak my guest and I ordered had a sweet taste which we had not expected, and when we asked him about it, he quickly responded the didn't know, then told it us, dismissively, that is was the worcester sauce - while he was walking away from us, making us feel like he just didn't care to respond. He never asked if we didn't like it, was there a problem For what our meals costs, and based on experiences with other high end steakhouses, we were very disappointed in this meal."
07/12/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"It really shows that a celebrity can do more than just slap their name on something. Quality was the main concern here. MJ has been successful with this chain because it is top notch. Expensive for a common man like myself, but it felt special for a birthday celebration and you get what you pay for. I recommend it the next time you need a special place on a special day with a special person."
07/12/2009,Shmoopy,2.0,Very expensive for the quality. Over rated. Would not return.
07/11/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Consistently excellent service and outstanding food. The garlic bread, lobster mashed potatoes, corn ""off the cob"" and Kansas City steak are a few of my favorites."
07/11/2009,Edk41,5.0,"Food was fantastic, a little expensive, but its fine every now an then. I will be back"
07/03/2009,jazzyjoz,5.0,"Outstanding meal! Everything we ate exceeded our expectations. I requested a booth and got it. Our reservation was on-time. Cocktails were good, and the fondue appetizer was the perfect start to our meal. The Delmonico steak was extremely tender. The balsamic chicken special was so juicy, just perfect. All of our sides were fantastic including the Yukon potatoes, cheddar mac & cheese, and asparagus. Nice wines, many available by the glass. We were too stuffed for dessert but everything sounded good. The only complaint is that our appetizer arrived and almost immediately our salads followed. I explained to our server that we were NOT in a rush and had a relaxing time the rest of the night. We can’t wait to go again and try their new menu whi"
06/27/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Great food. I gave it an excellent mark for service due to the fantastic waitress that we had. She was knowledgable, courteous and attentive. Other wait staff were also superb.
There was a little longer than average wait between courses. Other than that an outstanding dining experience!!!"
06/27/2009,eddrotman,2.0,we have eaten in MJ's many many times and enjoyed our food. We usually get the cowboy steaks and in the past they were excellent. On this visit our steak was quite poor and we were very disappointed. We should have sent it back but we were pressed for time and decided not to say anything.
06/21/2009,CMFost23,1.0,"After reading the reviews of this restaurant on opentable.com, I was excited about my dinner until I sat down and started eating it.

The Tune Tartar that I had for an app was bland and not very flavorful and my wife crabcake was just ok. I shared the porterhouse for 2 with the watercress/horseradish crust (which is more like a sauce than a crust). The flavor was OK but the quality of the steak was disappointing. For dessert I had the trio of Creme Brulee which I was supposed to be 3 different flavors and to be honest with I could not taste a difference in any of them.

Overall the meal was overpriced and not very good plus the service was horrible. This is a restaurant I would not eat at again."
06/21/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"It was great as always. Great service, great food, always consistent."
06/20/2009,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Need to develelop a better ""queue"" system....people standing everywhere and no order when it came to seating-we waited 30 minutes beyond our reservation time and several people were seated before us that were a little louder and more obnoxious-
...food very good and we had a nice server ""Brian""

Even though they are in a casino environment they could spend a little more time training the ""ladies"" at the front! They looked harried and disorganized!"
06/20/2009,OpenTable Diner,2.0,Nothing special. Had to wait for our table for 20 minutes although we had reservations and some tables were empty. The table service was very good and attentive. Steaks were overcooked and thin and not the quality you'd expect for the price. Very noisy atmosphere. Martinis were served in non-martini glasses and were not chilled at all. They might as well have poured it right from the bottle. For the price they charge I'd expect a great deal more. Too bad it's not a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.
06/19/2009,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Good quality meat, unfortunately it was slightly over cooked, not very hot and it was dry."
06/17/2009,RitaA,4.0,"I think the food is a little too pricey. Good, but pricey!"
06/17/2009,patz,5.0,It was outstanding!! The food was exceptional and the waiter & waitresses phenominal! It was a memorable night and meal!!
06/07/2009,CTgirl,5.0,Fantastic service and great food! We will definitely go back soon!
05/30/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We had another wonderful dinner at Michael Jordan's. The food is always superb. The crab cake, porterhouse, 1 lb baked potato, and hot chocolate cake severed with cinnamon ice cream were delightful. This was the best meal I have had in quite awhile. The server lacked personality, but overall it was a great experience. I would highly recommend Micheal Jordan's for a couple or small group looking for a great night out."
05/22/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The staff was excellent and very professional. The food was timely and very good! Our booth provided a romantic ambiance, which was what I was going for when I made the reservation. We had a wonderful experience and will definitely come again."
05/16/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The food was excellent, as usual. Great atmosphere and great service."
05/10/2009,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Fantastic!!! Pleased at the quality of steaks, and side dishes. Great desserts pleased as well! Atmosphere was different and was almost like a lounge. We liked it! It was great food to celebrate Mother's Day!!!

My only complaint was service. The girl handling the drinks condescendingly commented to my brother ""you know the steaks come with their own knifes"" and snapped his regular knife away from him. That was uncalled for and would never would occur in some of the better steakhouses we've been to like Keens in New York, or Emeril's Delmonico in New Orleans."
05/10/2009,LincolnHillBear,4.0,"Our party of three found the appetizers to be excellent and the entree for three of us was outstanding. I ordered the Kobe flatiron steak cooked medium rare and found it to be tough. two others ordered it rare and raved about it. It may have been my cut of meat.
Otherwise I would highly recommend it."
05/08/2009,AinaM,4.0,"I love this restaurant and always enjoy it, but I felt it was awful that on a Friday night at 6pm they were out of the salmon. It is a regular menu item, and they did not have it. They should have least had another fish, as a special, to replace it. I realize they are a steak place, but one member of our party eats fish and was looking forward to the salmon. She was quite disappointed."
05/03/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The best filet mignon I've ever eaten. EVER...!!!
05/03/2009,Foodbag,4.0,"We had a much needed date night here while our teenagers were at a concert. The restaurant surpassed our expectations. The martinis were generous and cold, the service from our waiter Michael was personal and professional-- he knew the menu inside and out. The porterhouse for two was cooked just as we ordered it, and was delicious.
I would go back."
05/03/2009,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The restaurant is a little too pricey, otherwise it was good."
05/02/2009,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"Very disappointing. Two requests were denied outright. While the filets were excellent, the flank steak was grissly. This is a restaurant that plays one note. Do not look for anything special."
04/26/2009,Lara,4.0,The food and service was great. My only complaint is that the restaurant area was extremely noisy. We weren’t even sitting right near the bar and it was really noisy. It was hard to hear my boyfriend speaking and he was sitting right across from me.
04/18/2009,brewsta,5.0,"Our server, Jordan, was excellent and we all enjoyed our dinner immensely.
Thank you,
Bruce Jergensen"
04/17/2009,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"Bring your wallet and your appetite! Overall a decent - if pricey - dining experience with good service, great wine list (including a lot of by-the-glass options), and food prepared as ordered. Unfortunately I don't think the complete package is as good as what you'll find at Craftsteak at Foxwoods for about the same price, though. Craftsteak's side dishes are far superior and while the meat quality and variety in cut are comparable, Craftsteak's selection is better."
04/09/2009,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Food is wonderful, service has always been good. They've added a special from Sun-Thurs called ""it takes 2"" that gives a great 4 course meal and a bottle of wine for $89. May be the best value in the casino!"
04/08/2009,Meatballs2go,5.0,Very pleasant experience. My daughter wanted to go to Mohegan Sun and I wanted to go to Michael Jordan's steakhouse - so we compromised - i paid for the room and she paid for dinner. it was a great treat for both of us.
04/05/2009,DwayneS,5.0,"The notes i put into the requests were actually read and taken to heart. We were given a nice quiet booth, out of the way. And two glasses of very good champagne on the house for our anniversary. Our waiter, Michaeal (ironic) was outstanding. His suggestions hit the spot. While not hovering, he knew exactly when to return and assist us."
04/04/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"I made reservations for Michael Jordan's online, that worked out well.We walked right in at our 7pm reservation, and was seated right away. We were at the steakhouse side. The food was VERY good. The servers were very attentive, friendly and quick. Be sure to get into Mohegan Sun with enough time to make your reservation, because we parked outside, traveled by shuttle, and then had to walk through, around,and upstairs to get there on time! We were there on an anniversary dinner.It was a great choice.Oh, and be sure to try the 'kit-kat'desert!"
04/04/2009,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"We went to MJ's for a nice quite dining experience as it turned 0ut it was not the case. I made reservation online, which was a simple experience that was very easy to do and with a confirmation. We arrived on time and we were seated at a 2 person table, which is my opinion is suitable for 1 person. We were sat at a table right next to a waiter station, now mind you this is at 5:30, I asked to be seated somewhere else so that we would not have to deal with the noise of clanking glasses,dishes and the banter of the waite staff. We were told that all tables were reserved and this was the only table available. Turned out that as of 7 p.m there was still 1/2 of the tables available. Would not recommend this place as a nice dining experience."
03/28/2009,KaraR,5.0,"Excellent. We went for my birthday and the food and service were wonderful. Would definitely go again, and recommend to friends."
03/24/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"As always, perfect in every way."
03/23/2009,flazzy,5.0,"We were celebrating our 35th wedding anniversary and it just so happened that they were offering a special couple's promotion which consisted of a bottle of wine, an appetizer, entree, veg or potatoe, and dessert for $90-. It was a fantastic deal. The waitstaff, manager and ambassador were fantastic and couldn't do enough for us. They went over and above. They even placed two candles in our dessert to celebrate our special day. All in all, the food was delicious, service was great and the price was more than reasonable. I would definitely go back again."
03/22/2009,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"We enjoyed this restaurant for the first time. Food was very good, good portions and they had a very extensive wine list. CONS- Even though we had a reservation we still had to wait a half an hour to be seated and there was no where to sit while we waited."
03/21/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,My girlfriend and I had an incredible time! The food and atmosphere was excellent and our server was awesome. Our dinner lasted 2 1/2 hours (we ordered a bottle of wine) and just was able to relax and enjoy ourselves without feeling rushed. Highly recommend!
03/21/2009,AnaT,5.0,"Best New York strip steak EVER! I ate at all the top steakhouse's in NYC and this steakhouse tops them all. THe only steakhouse comparible, maybe a little better, to this one is one in the Gaylord hotel in Dallas Texas (VERY famous one, I forget the name.)"
03/14/2009,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Food was excellent and wait staff were very attentive. Biggest disappointment was that there was a long wait to be seated - reservation had been made for 6:30 PM but was not seated until after 7:00 PM.
03/14/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food is always wonderful here. Get the garlic bread with bleu cheese fondue; it is to die for. The servers always ask to check for doneness of your meat and will quickly correct any problems (which there usually never are). Lobster Chowder is new on the menu and very delicious with chunks of lobster meat. The salmond was superb - cooked and seasoned to perfection.
03/14/2009,FoodFan,5.0,"Our experience at Michael Jordan's steakhouse was fabulous. The atmosphere was fun, the food fantastic and the service just perfect. We will certainly return."
03/13/2009,OpenTable Diner,2.0,The service was slow. The people around us were loud and yelling during what was a girls night out birthday party. Our server was nice but left us for long periods and our steaks were over cooked. I had been to the restaurant once before and thought it was outstanding. However it was not this time at all. Anyway hope you guys make it with this economy.
03/13/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Waitress was fantastic. Recommended a wine that was perfect for our meal and recommended after dinner drinks that complemented the whole evening. Staff was wonderful and so was the food. We will be back.
03/08/2009,Nomattr,4.0,"Fantastic food, great service and a cool setting. The best restaurant in Mohegan Sun."
03/08/2009,RobertP,3.0,"I found the restaruant kind of noisy and a bit cramped. My wife ordered her steak medium and when she cut into it, the steak looked medium. After eating it for a bit, the steak was well done. The steak was unevenly cooked. The restaruant took it off the bill."
03/06/2009,LauraS,5.0,Michael Jordan's Steakhouse is one of our favorite special occasion restaurants. The food is always excellent and the staff is attentive and professional. We requested a nice table and candle in our son's dessert for his birthday and everything was perfect. It was a memorable meal.
03/01/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The steaks were AMAZING!! Best I've ever had!
03/01/2009,DanielB,3.0,"Been going to MJs for a while now. Used to be my favorite. Last couple of times the service has gone downhill. The steaks are good, sides are OK. Noise level is similar to a crowded bar...

A couple of years ago I would have rated as 5 stars, now I dont belive it is worth the money."
02/28/2009,Tangosinger,4.0,"Food was good, but they double billed me on my casino card.
If I didn't look, I wouldn't have known.
I had to spend a good half hour of my time having them credit me back.
It makes me wonder about how many people they are ripping off."
02/22/2009,OpenTable Diner,3.0,It was great but they should do a better job with their reservations as we were not seated until 9:30 P.M. for a 9:00 P.M. reservation and the Metre'd wanted to excuse himself by saying that the reservation was for 9:30. Unfortunatelly everyone had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. Other than that everything was excellent!!
02/16/2009,PattiS,5.0,"Great food, wonderful service and nice atmosphere - great time."
02/13/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Everything was AWESOME...The garlic bread was amazing as was the filet.
02/11/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"The two for one was a tremendous deal, the service was impeccable and food tasted as great as it looked...(the presentation was wonderful."
02/08/2009,David,3.0,"Good to experience, however a little on the noisy/busy side.

I had a NY strip which was average, not worth $42. My wife had a filet and thought that it was better.

Lobster mashed potatos, blue cheese garlic bread and 23 layer cake are worth going for.

I have been 4 times and always been dissapointed in the steaks but service is good.

Next time I will try something else."
01/31/2009,HelenD,4.0,We had a great waiter. He was very attentive. Food was good - but not enough for the price. Potato salad came with the filet mignon. I would have preferred to have a choice.
01/18/2009,brewsta,4.0,"Thank you for your service!
Our waitress, Meagan, was very attentive and helpful. Seating was a little late but not a real problem. The steaks were excellent as were the appetizers and beverages."
01/18/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We had four fantastic dinners at Michael Jordans Steakhouse at Mohegan Sun.
We always have wonderful meals there. It is a favorite for us for special occasions.
Even though you usually have to wait for your table...even with reservations...it is worth it.
The place was packed because of the double event or a wine tasting and something else at the arena, but the ease of booking in the afternoon on line instead of being left on hold forever...was a very good experience.
This is my first time using opentable.com and I will definitely use it again."
01/17/2009,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Good vibes, good portions, great service."
01/17/2009,WilliamC,5.0,We are never disappointed when we dine here!
12/30/2008,BradW,4.0,"We made reservations and went before a show. The food was great, and the prices were very reasonable for a high end steak place. However, the table was not ready when we showed up for our reservation, and our waitress hardly came to check up on us.

If you are going to be at Moh. Sun anyway, its a great place to eat, you will be happy."
12/21/2008,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The food and service were excellent. We had a great time.
12/03/2008,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The food was absolutely wonderful, the service professional and knowledgeable! We could not have been more pleased. Definately exceeded our expectation."
12/03/2008,Sdk12345,4.0,"Steaks are top notch...tender, flavorful, melt-in-your-mouth. Did not care for the creamed spinach dish. The menu needs more side veggies in addition to the carb side dishes."
12/02/2008,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"My experience at Michael Jordan's was horrible. I had a reservation for 6:30 and was told that there were 10 other 6:30 reservations waiting to be seated before me. I waited until 7:00 and was still not seated for my 6:30 reservation. I was looking forward to this meal all week and didn't even get to eat there. So, my experience at Michael Jordan's was very disappointing."
11/27/2008,Lovely,4.0,"food is great, service is great, setting is great.....the only thing -- the strawberry shortcake was with frozen strawberries, the whip cream not tasty and the cookies too.
a nice fresh strawberry short cake....our question would you service Micheal Jordan the strawberry short cake you now have?

Best to you,
jaclyn and rob rothenberg"
11/26/2008,MaxD,4.0,"My wife and I ordered from the ""menu for 2,"" which offered very limited choices but was fine for us. I ordered the steak, which was cooked just like I wanted it. It was served over a bed of potatoe salad, which helped mellow out the sauce that was served on the steak. The sauce was a little strong but very accepable. My wife ordered the deep fried crab cakes, which were excellent. We also ordered mashed potatoes, which were good) and the ""off the cob grilled corn,"" which was excellent. Overall we gave our visit 2 thumbs up!"
11/16/2008,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The best steakhouse I have eaten in in years.
11/15/2008,AlexR,5.0,"We played at the tables, had a great dinner at Michael Jordans, went to the Elton John concert (fantastic!). The entire day was absolutely perfect."
11/14/2008,JohnF,2.0,"We ate here before an Elton John Concert at Mohegan Sun. It is an overpriced faux attempt to imitate a steakhouse. The service was attentive, the 46.95 strip steak was so gristly that at least 20% was waste.Very average at an overaverage price."
11/09/2008,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Food was excellent. Service was great.  Booth was cozy with velour seats and pillows.  Very comfortable.  Need reservations.
11/08/2008,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Food and service were good although pricey. Quick service.
11/08/2008,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"The service very good. My wives steak was not quite up to MJ's usual standard, but it was still very nice. Our only disappointment was that our table was too close to the kitchen area. Their was too much background noise from the kitchen area for our likeing."
10/28/2008,Folkstogether,4.0,"MJ's is inside the Mohegan Sun Casino so ambiance is not what it could be if it were located in a less frenetic environment.    With that said, they do their best to make this restaurant an outstanding dining experience.  It was our 20th anniversary so we were looking for a memorable dining experience and a reasonably romantic environment.  We were at the casino to attend a concert and I had heard good things about MJ's so we opted to go there.  We are steak fans and have eaten at Morton's and the Capital Grille.   The food at MJ's was top notch (you must have the garlic bread fondue). The Porterhouse steaks were cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth good.  The staff was attentive and even gave us free champagne.  We loved it!!!"
10/26/2008,litdoc,4.0,"when we arrived for our 5 pm reservation (they opened at 5) we were told we had a short wait. 20 minutes later I asked to see the manager who apologized and made sure we had a table only after explaining that we have never been put off like this when using open table and that my survey would indicate that.
After that food and service was very good."
10/25/2008,Martha,5.0,This is our second time at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse and it was fantastic again.  We enjoyed every single moment of it.  Thanks
10/24/2008,JeanneD,4.0,"Food and service was very good. It is very noisy, so it is hard to carry on a conversation."
10/24/2008,JStinson,5.0,"A+++++++++, Excellent service, excellent food, and excellent atmosphere!!! A must go-to restaurant!"
10/23/2008,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"I had eaten here several years ago and really enjoyed it and I was looking forward to returning.  I knew that the food was pricey but I was looking for a good meal and experience.  In short, it did not deliver.  The steak was so thick that the outside was overcooked in order to make the center medium rare and the macaroni was bland and cold.  The service was mediocre and the only bright spot was the garlic bread.  I could have eaten at Outback for a third of the price and gotten better food and service.  I was really disapointed in my meal after high expectations."
10/19/2008,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Great food! Great sevice! Loved the waitstaff, they were knowlegeable and friendly and made dinner a joy!"
10/18/2008,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Great food!   Excellent service!  Can't wait to go back! However, kind of on the noisey side."
10/12/2008,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellent food!  Worth the trip even if you are not gambling!
10/11/2008,Totalenjoyment,4.0,"We had some great food and enjoyed most of our experience. I was very surprised to see young children and the noise level was tolerable but somewhat irritating. The mashed potatos were definatley mixed from an instant box mix, they were not at all fresh, anyone could make that distinction. The steak on the otherhand was magnifique`!"
10/04/2008,SusieC,4.0,I've been there four times and the food is always very good and the staff is terrific...best garlic bread in the world!!!
10/04/2008,rlittle244,5.0,Always the best food!
09/29/2008,skibum682013,2.0,"Kansas City Strip was served with a Southwest seasoning despite no reference to it on the menu. When I asked the manager about it, he became argumentative. The waiter was also argumentative with us concerning the quality of the steak. Filet Mignon and Scallop special was not served hot. Waiter was not very attentive. Note this was the first bad experience at the restaurant in about 15 visits."
09/27/2008,Foodlove,1.0,"Worst high end steakhouse I've been to.  Not even close to being on par with the Ruth Chris, Smith & Wollensky, Morton's, etc.  Steak was obviously not high quality and most likely wet aged choice.  Did not taste prime and more like a brined piece of meat.  No grill flavor and actually look and tasted like it was quickly grilled and then reheated on skillet.  I've had a better steaks at Outback...

I am acknowledged every time I note an anniversay or birthday celebration on my Open Table reservation at other restaurant.  Not even a mention from the hostess or asked if I wanted to do something special for my wife's birthday celebration discreetly."
09/26/2008,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Outstanding!
09/19/2008,bingoprof,2.0,"Third time after two memorable visits. Third time was not the charm. Something seems to be off, as if the place is resting on its laurels."
09/18/2008,none,3.0,"It was my mom's Birhtday and the staff forgot to bring out the birhtday candle. I have requested it on the Opentable comments, I was very dissappointed!!"
09/18/2008,OpenTable Diner,5.0,we had an awesome meal everything was outstanding in its own way.
09/13/2008,JVinPA,1.0,"Not as good as it used to be (when they first opened, the place was awesome).  However, this time, quite the antithesis.  Cut of steak was grainy.  Wife's cut was cooked incorrectly and they challenged her based on how she ordered it (clearly, she was right) -- so in essence, she was stuck with a steak cooked not to her liking.

Much rather go to their other steakhouse or go to Foxwoods and go to either David Burke or craftsteak..."
09/12/2008,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Steak was unbelievable!   The couple of sides we chose were just as good as the steak
the corn out of this world as well as their onion rings!"
09/01/2008,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Upon checking in 15 minutes early for a 9PM. reservation, the hostess said that it would be still a 15 minute wait for a table. The restaurant had at least 15 empty tables. I mean totally empty. I asked the hostess if they were empty due to being short staffed with waiters and waitreses and she said no. She said that was the rules. You have to wait up to a 1/2 hour for your table. We did and were seated in approx. 15 minutes. After being seated, there were now at least 20 table empty. I originally had a 8:30PM reservation and changed it to 9PM. to be a little early instead of late. If that was the case that they hold reservations up to 30 minutes after your reservation time,  should have played the late game also. The hostess was lying."
08/30/2008,OpenTable Diner,4.0,We loved the food it was great also the waiter was awesome! The whole experience was very good the only thing was that it was a little too much noise for us. The waiter recommended next time to ask for a more private area which they can accommodate.
08/29/2008,steve,2.0,"while the food was on par with all other great steakhouses i have been to including ruths chris, flemings, and abe & louis, the overall rating was greatly reduced due to the lack of service we experienced, which i would think would be better at a higher priced place like michael jordans. the waiter rarely came to our table and it didnt not seem busy at all.  another couple that was seated after us received they're appatizers and main course before we got our salads!!  but the food was very good, i would go back in hopes of better service!"
08/28/2008,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Best steak I had ever had.  Every part of the meal was delicous - salad, main course and all side dishes.  Everything you could want in a quality steak restaurant."
08/23/2008,ChristineV,4.0,"Michael Jordans is known as expensive and great gourmet steak house.  We found that the prices were high, but not as bad as you would think.  If you avoide the steak you can eat for about $30 a plate, and you only really need to share one side because they are huge!
In addition the desserts are huge and can be shared by at least two.  The flight of Creme Brule which was only about $8 had three of creme brulee's - enough for at least 3 people!
We enjoyed our dinner there but would not go there regularly unless it was for a special occasion.  You definately need a reservation and open table is great for that because online we could get a 7:30 reservation for 2, but when you call the restaraunt they said they had nothing open until 9!"
08/23/2008,Martha,5.0,"We were very impressed about Michael Jordan's Restaurant.  Everything was fantastic.  We got there by 7PM and told our waitress that we had to leave by 8PM to attend a concert.  She took care of us in a very efficient and professional way.

We'll return on October 25th !  Thanks again"
08/13/2008,NickyB,5.0,The food was outstanding and the service was excellent!
08/01/2008,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great restaurant without one bad thing to say.  Outstanding
08/01/2008,TrishG,3.0,"Food was very tasty, however my meat was not cooked as I ordered it.  By the time they came back with it, my husband was almost finished his meal.  Not an ideal situation, and the staff offered nothing in compensation.  Steaks were very good cuts and very flavorful.  Garlic bread with cheese fondue was out of this world.  Atmosphere was very noisy and tables are not ideal for 2 as you are on a banquette with other couples."
08/01/2008,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"Unfortunately, it wasn't as wonderful as in the past.  The grande shellfish tower was ok but the lobster and crablegs weren't sweet and were tough.  The service was ok but not the usual.  However the cosmos are the best!  MJ was our favorite at Mohegan but we'll start trying other restaurants now after this experience."
07/28/2008,Mlasser,4.0,"I have been here before and have been underwhelmed by the steaks.  This time, however, everything was top notch and on par with the top steakhouses across the country.  Kudos to the Michael Jordan team for creating a memorable meal with top flight service."
07/27/2008,OpenTable Diner,4.0,fun experience as always.
07/26/2008,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Michael Jordan's is our favorite place to dine.  The service and food is exceptional.
07/25/2008,paula,4.0,"The crab cakes were out of this world.

I do think booking through Mohegan Sun through you should qualify for points.  It's just easier to do everything on one web site."
07/25/2008,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"We go to Michael Jordans all the time. This was the first time that we were very disappointed in the food We love the Kansas city strip med Pink all the way through. It came out well done. They had to bring us another one , was raw. It was a bad experience. Had guests with us, it was inbaresing. They were finished with there dinner before we got our steak. I don't know if we will come there for a while. The waiter was very good. He was very apoligetic.  Margaret Kraemer"
07/20/2008,OpenTable Diner,5.0,One of the best steaks I have ever enjoyed!
07/20/2008,Pops,4.0,Very good for a restaurant in a Casino.
07/19/2008,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"We were celebrating a special birthday by taking him to Michael Jordans Steakhouse. When we first walked in the hostess was extremely rude. She was talking to her co-worker and ignored us while we stood in front of her.  Then, she motioned for us to sit on the couches while we wait. We proceeded to the couches and sat down, but she ran over and rudely told us that we had to leave the restaurant because we had coffee from Starbucks and their liquor license didn't allow any outside beverages inside. We finished out coffee outside the restaurant and went back in.  Now, she scurried ahead of us to show us our table.  She seemed like she was in a rush. Overall the food & our waiter were okay,but she set the mood which was not a positive one."
07/18/2008,DaveFromMass,3.0,Steak is good quality but the sauces are bland.  Need to serve a good mushroom wine sauce with it.  The au jus was watery and bland.
07/14/2008,OpenTable Diner,3.0,We felt that our filet mignon was tasteless & consequently too expensive.  Our Appetisers & desserts were delious.
07/13/2008,Rickfic,4.0,"The food was very good, but was a bit underwhelmed with the service."
07/12/2008,Edwayland,5.0,Excellent food and service
07/10/2008,rvdreamin,5.0,This was out second trip to this restaurant...  Love the back room for quiet dining.
07/09/2008,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"For a steakhouse, they could not get a  Filet Mignon cooked ""Medium"" correctly!.  The initial plate did not come to the table hot and was sent back only to be returned overcooked.  They were very accomodating in offering me a new steak, but this came to the table red and Medium Rare, not pink.  Back it went, and it eventually came to the table redder than I like but I accepted the dish with frustration.  This maybe would have been acceptable (a) were they giving the steaks away for less than the $37 charged or (b) if they were a pasta house and not an allegedly renowed steakhouse.  The wait staff was attentive and apologetic and the manager comped me the meal which was appreciated; yet my dining there was disappointing to say the least!"
07/07/2008,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Great time!!! Porter House was amazing!!!!
07/07/2008,OpenTable Diner,3.0,"we waited terribly long for a table although half the restaurant was empty.  otherwise, our waiter was friendly and the food was good."
07/04/2008,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellent food and service
07/01/2008,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Portions were huge. Waitress should have advised us that we over-ordered for two.
06/28/2008,LisaL,3.0,We had eaten here before and this was not one of the best times - although it was good.  My husband did not really enjoy his $50 steak but my salmon was outstanding.  Its really a great place for groups with their fabulous family-style side dishes.  It was very very loud - but it sort of fit the scene of the casino.  Drinks are very expensive and they were weak.  Our service was fantastic - and always is there.
06/28/2008,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"Watch your credit card statement here. Waiter treated himself to an extra $20. Management fixed the problem by phone a few weeks later, but in my mind did not do enough considering how bad it makes their restaurant look. Billy Joel was great though!"
06/27/2008,JVLevEsq,3.0,"Food was very good.  Server was not very knowledgeable, advice was based only on up-sell (most expensive wine does not mean best wine available).  Server was able to advise on Chef's propensity to overcook, great advice.  Very loud and obnoxious crowd, it is in a Casino.  Would consider a return if private dining for 2 is available.  Graffiti was on the leather wall hangings.  Hostess was excellent, very pleasant, set the mood for the night very well.  Southeastern Connecticut needs Capital Grille, or equivalent."
06/27/2008,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Excellent food and service
06/24/2008,AZwhaler,2.0,had to send back the steak twice. Service was slow and inattentive. I've liked this restaurant in the past but last night's meal was a disaster.
06/22/2008,DocHolland,5.0,I have always found this restaurant at Mohegan Sun to be top notch - it never disappoints us.
06/22/2008,Edwrd,3.0,"The food was good, but not quite as good as other visits over the last few the years. We were expecting to be dazzled with great flavors as we were with previous meals.  The waiter, Robert, did a fantastic job along with the young lady assisting him ... very attentive. Will definitely be back but hoping to be dazzled one again!"
06/18/2008,WendyB,4.0,"This is our third time at MJ's. The drinks were large, the steak was perfect and it was pretty much empty as usual. We eat early since we skip lunch. All in all, it was as good as it always has been."
06/15/2008,Aliekat24,3.0,Service was wonderful.  2 out of the 3 entrees were excellent.  One filet was a bit over-cooked on the outside.
06/15/2008,ElliotZ,4.0,The restaurant brought us to a table 20 minutes after our reservation.
06/15/2008,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"great food, great enviroment, great place to eat out exspecially for a special occasion!!!

definently would come back!"
06/14/2008,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"I was expecting more from a restaurant with Michael Jordan's name on it. I love steak, and I did not love it here!"
06/14/2008,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"I was very disappointed with the service.  I requested a mid rare porterhouse Steak and received a well done steak.  I returned it and once again got a over done steak with the same fry's from the frist plate.  When I called the setion manager over to tell him of my disatsifactiowere n he said ""what is it now"".  I wasn't expecting that kind of statement. I wasn't just disappointed with the food but I was also distrubed  at the treatment I had received. This was suppose to be a special occation for us, it was fathers day weekend and this was my treat for my husband. Instead it was an upsetting night. I will never go out of my way eat there again. I would like them to know my feed back.

06/08/2008,OpenTable Diner,4.0,There are two must have on their menu the garlic bread with a blue cheese fondue and their smoke macroni and cheese.
05/31/2008,OpenTable Diner,4.0,long wait even with reservation. almost late for a concert.
05/31/2008,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"My experience was excellent, the food was delicious and the service by Curt couldn't have been better. We had an hour and ten mins to get in and out for a show and they did everythign they could to help and it was a packed house. I'll be going back. thank you."
05/31/2008,hallhigh70,3.0,"Truthfully, I'm not sure that it was that great--good bordering on fair. They have a great appetizer garlic bread with a blue cheese dip. My lamb chops were unrecognizable in the cut--chunks of meat with a big piece of bone on each--tasted okay, nothing special and hard to cut around the bone. The place is very noisy with a loud drum beat music that was very irritating. The service was okay. My roasted beet salad was good, but my husband's shrimp cocktail was mediocre--3 small shrimp with no flavor. We did not have dessert. My husband's coffee was weak and he thought it tasted like Starbucks typical burnt grind. His steak was okay, nothing special. If we were to go back to Mohegan Sun, we would choose another restaurant over this place."
05/28/2008,Mlasser,3.0,"While the salads and sides where all very good, the steak itself was subpar.  Two of us had the Kansas City Strip steak which was undercooked, tough and overall just not very flavorable.  At a steakhouse their steak should be the star, but unfortunately that was not the case.  To be fair, I have eaten here before and the steaks were quite good.  Hopefully this was just a bad night and not the new norm"
05/25/2008,BruceA,5.0,leave room for the Baked Alaska
05/25/2008,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"Great food, great service, everything was excellent!"
05/21/2008,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Probably one of the finest steaks I've had.  Little pricey but would go again
05/20/2008,RobG,5.0,We were a bit rushed to get to a concert and the staff made sure we arrived on time. Everything was very well co-ordinated and tasted great!
05/12/2008,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Overall, I had a great time. The only thing that upset me was that the hostess would not sit us until our entire party arrived.(Someone was late.) This has not happened before. I do not understand the reasoning behind it. I feel it should be up to the party to decide if they prefer to wait or be seated. Customer comfort should be your number one priority. The table service was excellent, the food was excellent. But the hostess left a bad taste in my mouth. I would rate her service as poor to fair. Otherwise, I would have marked Outstanding on service!"
05/11/2008,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Overall very good and we will be back.  We had one problem--while waiting for a table we wanted a draft beer.  Seeing no draft taps at the bar in the steak house we went to the bar next door (also Michael Jordan) and got a draft beer.  Almost immediately our table was ready so we tried to bring the beer into the dining room.  Not allowed--as we quickly learned from the drink police.  Suggest you do something to prevent this from happening--it can really turn people off.
05/10/2008,Aliekat24,4.0,"The food was delicious.  2 of us had the filets and were wonderful.  1 had the salmon and found it to be a bit overcooked.  The beet salad and lobster bisque were delicious!Being a Friday night, it was exceptionally loud and noisy.  Overall, I always enjoy this restaurant and will be back."
05/08/2008,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"Environment was very loud, I often felt like I was shouting across the table from my date.  However, food was very good and our server was a very kind and helpful man...service was outstanding!"
05/03/2008,JaniceM,5.0,"I have ate at Michael Jordan's Steakhouse a number of times, it is one of my favorite restaurants at Mohegan Sun Casino. Every time I visit it is always a very enjoyable time. The staff is very attentive and highly professional."
04/28/2008,PeggyD,1.0,We eat there alote. The service has hit a all time low. Our last waiter and bus boy must of just graduated from McDonald's. They just flopped the food down and that was about the last time we saw them. We had ordered 2 bottles of wine and a ice bucket. There was only 10-20 ice cubes in the bucket. Our check is always $300-$400 we will absolutely not go back. Use to be the place to for a good steak and wonderful service. Not anymore!
04/25/2008,OpenTable Diner,1.0,"The visit was disappointing at best. While our reservation was available, we were directed to the bar for cocktails. We sat while one bartender did dishes and the other talked with wait staff. Courtesy was lacking in all areas. Special events (wife's birthday) was requested, but ignored. Meal quality and service is better at lower cost chains - even had to ask twice for the baked potato and salad dressing. Prices were Ruth Chris level for mediocrity. Francis R. Powell - name may be used."
04/24/2008,OpenTable Diner,5.0,It was dynomite!
04/20/2008,OpenTable Diner,2.0,"Steaks were not cooked to order, so 2 of us had to eat after the others were done.  This has happened 2 times before...this may be our last time dining here"
04/19/2008,OpenTable Diner,5.0,The service and food here is always consistently good. It's very obvious that the cooks and management take their jobs seriously.
04/19/2008,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Friendly staff. Food presentation wonderful. Taste outstanding. Second time here and will be back again.
04/18/2008,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Our experience at Michael Jordan's was incredible. The food was delicious and cooked as ordered. The service was fantastic. I will always go back to Michael Jordan's at Mohegan Sun.

04/11/2008,OpenTable Diner,5.0,Our reservation was for 7PM and we did not get in until 7:40PM.  Other than that it was GREAT.
04/11/2008,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Fabulous shellfish platter - wonderful delmonico steak.  Very noisy for tables near bar - back half of restaurant pleasant atmosphere. Service is outstanding!!
04/06/2008,OpenTable Diner,3.0,Excessive noise - greater attention should have been spent on acoustic design.
04/06/2008,EllenZ,4.0,"I expected to wait even though we had a reservation.  We were taken on time!  I enjoyed the ambiance, but it was too noisy.  Prehaps a quiter spot in the restaurant would be in the booths with drapes on three sides. My food was fine, but I think the steaks were good.  I had a bite from my husband's plate."
03/29/2008,OpenTable Diner,4.0,I had requested a quiet spot for dininand in a loud restaurant they found it. The food and service were great! Best meal in a long time. I would go back again! Craig
03/23/2008,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"we had a booth towards the back, and found the service to be great, the staff to be exceptional and the food to be very enjoyable.  after having a couple of glasses of different red and white wines, we asked the waitreess to bring us one more glass of red, that she would recommend, she very graciously said sure, and brought us a glass that we enjoyed the most that evening.  we would highly recommend this place."
03/19/2008,Mike40,5.0,"This restraunt needs a kids menu, we dine there very often..."
03/19/2008,OpenTable Diner,4.0,Food was incredible! Worth the money. Definitely going back!
03/15/2008,OpenTable Diner,4.0,"We had a reservation at 630...We were finally seated at 7:10.  We had a show to get to for 8pm.  I told our server, Heather, this and she was amazing.  We ordered as soon as Heather came to the table, as we reviewed the menu during our wait, got our apps and then the meal at 7:30.  I really thought we would miss our show's beginning but the hostess as well as Heather told me not to worry.  I was a little irritated at the wait but being it was a saturday night as well as a very big show to be seen it is understandble...A comp drink or round couldve been suggested by the hostess as some restaurants do offer this in a time like this.  All in all i was impressed by how quickly Heather took care of us.  She did a great job."
03/15/2008,TiffanyS,4.0,"It was so busy - even with a reservation, the wait was over 40 minutes.  Not a good choice if you are cathcing a show!"
03/14/2008,OpenTable Diner,5.0,"We had a wonderful dining experience. The food was cooked perfectly, our wait staff was very attentive and unobtrusive. One of the best dining experiences I've had."
03/14/2008,CLYDES,4.0,Heather our server was excellent!
01/01/2008,Trish,4.0,"Excellent place for a steak or special meal.  Certainly spendy, but worth the price if you are willing to pay for it!"
